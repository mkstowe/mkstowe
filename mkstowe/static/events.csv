5587,0,"Hello, adventurer! It seems that some random village has been beset by that big ol' beastie pictured over there.  Cute, isn't he?  Of course, being the hero that you are, it's obviously your duty to fight it. So, what are you waiting for?  First off, you'll have to select your job. Your job affects what abilities you have.           "
5587,1,"Excellent choice!  You charge off to beat up the Behemoth..."
5587,2,"Sword in hand, you stand in a ready stance. The Behemoth growls."
5587,3,"You attack the Behemoth.  It swings a massive claw at you. Ouch."
5587,4,"You leap forward, slashing twice at the Behemoth.  The Behemoth counters with a mighty blow."
5587,5,"Your health is... well... how much health you have. If it drops below zero, it's game over. Don't worry, it's not going to stay at 1. Since different jobs will have different amounts of health, you'll get the rest of your health after you click the link to begin the fight.  The variable entitled Behemoth is how much health your foe has. You want this to drop to zero.  Mana is required to use certain skills. Once it drops to zero... well, it's not game over, but you won't be able to use some skills. Once again, you'll get the rest of your mana after you begin the fight.  Your Drivemeter will raise as you perform actions. Once it reaches ten, you will be able to perform an Overdrive attack. The Overdrive varies with each job.     "
5587,6,"Excellent choice!  You charge off to zap, burninate or freeze the Behemoth (depending on your mood)..."
5587,7,"Staff in hand, you stand in a ready stance. The Behemoth snarls."
5587,8,"You cast Fire at the Behemoth.  It responds with Thunder."
5587,9,"You cast Thunder.  Unfortunately, this Behemoth absorbs lightning. So, basically, you've just healed him.  It grins infuriatingly at you."
5587,10,"You cast Blizzard.  Shivering, the Behemoth counters with Thunder."
5587,11,"You cast Cure, and restore some of your health."
5587,12,"Excellent choice!  You charge off to beat up the Behemoth...  but not before snatching these items."
5587,13,"You stand, daggers at the ready. The Behemoth bares its teeth at you."
5587,14,"You examine the Behemoth closely... very closely.  You determine that you have approximately a 1 in 3 chance of successfully stealing an item from it, and that using a lightning-based attack will simply heal the monster.  You also determine that the Behemoth is allergic to Scan by experience when it lets out a mighty sneeze in your direction. Although it doesn't do that much damage, it's still pretty annoying."
5587,15,"You attempt to steal from the Behemoth..."
5587,16,"Your attempt is unsuccessful.  The Behemoth, a wee bit irked at you, casts Thunder."
7397,0,"Chapter 1: Dark Beginnings   Well, you did it again. You slacked off all semester and didn’t study for your finals. There’s no way you’re going to pass your nature magic test tomorrow. Those things are always killers. You don’t even know why you enrolled in that class; you aren’t even interested in being a nature mage. You don’t even like the damn outdoors!  Oh wait, you know why, it’s because you saw a cute witch taking the class, so like a dumb ass, you signed up for it. Naturally the moment you tried to impress her with some sort of cantrip, she laughed at you and said even if she was straight, she wouldn’t go for a half assed hedge wizard like you! You really should’ve known better, half of those witches are lesbians anyway. That whole Mother Earth Goddess worship caters to the rug munching. (And no, there aren’t any MALE witches, any self respecting man would call himself a WARLOCK, not a damn witch!)  (Sigh) Like your little sister’s B’ar’b Dolly once said “Magic is hard!” Indeed. Sometimes you curse the day your mother passed her magical elven blood on to you.  Still, you’re here now, so you need to make the best out of your life. You’re already going to hear it from both of your parents of how you’ve been nothing but a disappointment to the both of them. Your Dad will probably do a little more than say that, he’ll probably personally ride up to the University and beat the hell out of you for wasting his hard earned pillaging money to send you there in the first place.  Arrgh! You just wish you were good at SOME kind of magic! You have the ability; you just don’t have the focus! That’s always been the problem with you. Your sister has it easy, she took after Dad. Narrow minded focus on killing someone with a blunt instrument doesn’t take too much effort. Of course you had to be the one that greater things were expected of.  You’ve tried all the schools, evocation, conjuration, illusion, divination; all of them. You can’t excel in any of it. You can only get so far and then the words and gestures and well all of it just becomes too fucking confusing for you.  However, you haven’t tried the “darker arts”, but your Mom would definitely never approve. (Your Dad probably wouldn’t care, but if you upset your Mom, it’s a warhammer upside the head) In fact it’s illegal to study any of them. They caused too much trouble in the past and nearly destroyed the world at one time. All who are known to even dabble in such arts are immediately taken into custody and executed.  You don’t think you’d want to be summoning demons anyway; even the few “friendly ones” that work on campus are fucking assholes to the Nth degree. You can only imagine how bad the ones who haven’t been living among mortals are.  However there is another dark art which you have to admit you’ve always had a bit of curiosity about.  The art in question is necromancy.  At this point you’re willing to at least see if you’re good at ANYTHING, so for shits and giggles you decide to blow off your test which you’re going to fail anyway and go see if you can find out more about this outlawed dark art.  Though being a lazy sort you decide to try the library first."
7397,1,"Even though you’re supposed to be a wizard in training, you spend as little time as possible in library if you can help it. Normally you just check out whatever you need to read for a class and leave.  You have little faith in finding anything substantial on Necromancy in there, but maybe you can find something that will at least quell this thirst for knowledge on it. You realize you’re treading on dangerous ground, but you have to try to learn more.  The library is huge however, and you’re unsure of where to look, it’s not like there’s a section on Necromancy or Outlawed Magic, but you figure you’ll look in the History section first.  You glance and browse through the stacks until you pick up a few choice books that look like they might contain something, sit down in a quiet corner and begin to read. Naturally you don’t learn too much. The history books mainly go on about how bad the Dead War was, important battles, the atrocities of the Lich Lord, the typical stuff you’ve read time and time again. Still, you’re determined to find something new.  You spend hours reading until you realize you’ve spent the day in the library and that it’s now night time. Oddly the library is mostly empty, and that’s probably because finals are now over, one of which you’ve now undoubtedly failed. You think of how stupid you’ve been to obsess over an outlawed art that you probably wouldn’t be any good at anyway! You’ve only been dwelling on the subject to ignore your own problems that you could’ve tried to solve yourself, instead of fantasizing about being some Necromancer. Raising the dead…what good would that do you? Delusions of grandeur. You wouldn’t have enough motivation to try to take over the world anyway. There was only one person who truly motivated you, and she’s gone.  You begin to think about Serena and begin to feel sorrow like when you first lost her. You’ve had enough of death. You leave the library in a daze and head back home to sleep off this miserable day.  You can’t escape though; even your dreams bring death. You dream about Serena. At first she’s alive and vibrant, and then suddenly she dies before your eyes. Then you see her grave with you sobbing over it and shouting how you demand that she not leave you.  Then she rises from her grave…and you wake up only to come face to face with her! She is a ghost floating near your bed.  “HOLY SHIT!” you shout and back up against your headboard. “Shhhh! Hush my love, I’m risking a lot just by being here.” She says looking around as if someone is going to bust down your door any minute. “Serena, what’s going on? This isn’t a dream is it?” “No, my dear I assure you that I am very real. And I have a message for you.” “A message?” “Yes, embrace death and all the beauty it has to offer.” “You want me to kill myself, to join you?” Serena laughs a bit. “No silly, you are to become a necromancer and bring the purity of death to the world.” “…yeah right. With my aptitude of magic, I doubt if I could raise a mouse skeleton.” “You always did lack confidence in yourself. I suppose that’s why they sent me to motivate you one last time. Though I admit, I would’ve come to see you anyway.” “They?”  Serena side steps your question and continues.  “Look we haven’t much time, but you HAVE the ability to become the greatest Necromancer since the Great Lich Lord who brought the world near the brink of extinction centuries ago, but you cannot do it alone…at least not yet. You must have allies. There are others like you on this campus who long to practice the dark arts. Seek them out and take over this college as your first step to your destiny.” “What? Hold on! What makes you think I want to do all this?”  Serena floats closer to you and touches your face with a ghostly hand. You feel completely calm.  “Because deep down it IS what you want. You know your thoughts are dominated by death. You even think of me rather than living girls and I’ve been dead for years. The very fact that your mind played a part in summoning me here is also proof of your desire.” “I miss you…” “I know you do, but my point is, even before I died I remember you having an interest in the dark arts. Indeed it’s part of what attracted me to you. But now I must return and you must fulfill your part in this world, whether you succeed or fail at this endeavor will ultimately be up to you, but I believe you will succeed.”  Serena then floats a little closer to kiss you.  “Farewell, my love.” She says and then disappears.  You’re now wide awake and pacing the floor. You’ve been ambivalent about pursuing this path before, but the more you think about it and with this visit from Serena, this is the path you’re going to choose. And why not? It’s not like you have any better options in your life at this point.  You’re going to do it, and though Serena mentioned others like you being on campus, you’re damned if you have a clue to as of knowing who they are since you don’t really socialize. Still, you can think of two people that could get you started. (Or at least not rat on you, when you start inquiring about Necromancy)  The next day you take your first steps towards darkness…"
7397,2,"Chapter 2: Death Awaits  Serena’s right, you’re going to need the help of others and you head to Mr. Demar’s office.  Mr. Demar’s class was probably the only one you didn’t struggle in too much. It’s not really a popular field given that conjuration can lead to summoning demons. Still, there is use for it on a minor level, though of course it’s strictly regulated by most governments.  Mr. Demar was a good professor, but the general agreement by everyone in your class, was that he was REALLY creepy. Plus there were always rumors about him. You always got the impression he was interested in doing a lot more with his area of expertise, but had to settle for teaching. He always seemed to be alright with you though.  When you get to his office, surprisingly it’s open and he’s busily shuffling some papers around.  “Mr. Demar?” “Huh? What? Damn it, I thought I locked that door! Oh it’s you, what do you want? And lock that door.” “Well uh…I had some questions…” “Okay, what are they? Out with it.” He says continuing to look at some strange parchments. “Well, uh…I guess it’s about magic, and I guess um…”  Mr. Demar looks up at you like he’s going to slap you for stuttering so much. You finally speak up.  “I want to know more about Necromancy.”  Mr. Demar steps back and gives you a few inspecting stares.  “I dunno what you’re talking about, in fact if you don’t get out of here I’m going report you to the dean for asking such questions.” He warns, but you get the impression that he’s not telling the truth. He probably thinks you were sent to spy on him by the dean or something. It’s not like he hasn’t been held under close scrutiny before.  “Mr. Demar, I’m not trying to get you into trouble, it’s me! I really want to learn Necromancy, and you’re about the only one I think can help me! I actually was worried about coming to you and I was nervous about the whole thing!” “Hmm, well I guess I always did think you were inclined towards the dark arts and given your annoying stuttering a moment ago, you do sound like you were nervous. Okay, you want to learn? I’ll teach you. I’ll teach you like I’m currently teaching so many others right now. Surprised? Yes, the time is coming to pass that we who are inclined to REAL power begin to make our place in this world…permanently. Though I still have concerns about you, I mean while you did about average in my class, I’m well aware that you’re not exactly the best student in other fields. I question whether you can handle the power of the dark arts, let alone become a Necromancer.”  You stand up straight and reply. “I’m confident that this is my path.”  “Good, I’m glad you said that, because there’s no going back and this path is not for the weak. We also must maintain secrecy at all times until the day that we may take what is rightfully ours. Now come with me, we’re going to see exactly what kind of potential you have.”  Mr. Demar casts a spell and opens up a portal. He then prepares to enter it and beckons you to follow him, which you do. Suddenly you’re whisked away into a place of near darkness. Given your immediate surroundings you’d guess that you’re underground somewhere. You can hear the clinking of chains though nearby and moans.  “Where are we?” “Your testing area, this where we’re going to find out what exactly you’re made of. In the next room, you’ll find some undead friends. They’re currently chained up, but they won’t be for long. Now, you can kill them, but as a Necromancer you’re supposed to be controlling them, so obviously you should try to do that.” “But I don’t know how! You haven’t taught me any spells!” “And I’m not going to, you’re going to have to figure this out yourself, but I will say this, it’s all about the strength of willpower. Tap into your magical energy and if you have what it takes, you’ll succeed. I’ll leave you to it.”  Demar disappears back into the portal and leaves you all by yourself. You’ve really gotten yourself into it and now there really isn’t any going back, and you can hear the chains from the next room dropping to the ground and the moans getting louder and closer.  There’s a large bone on the ground and not much else in the room, and you can’t run either as there are no other exits."
7397,3,"You pick up the large bone and prepare for whatever is coming at you. A couple of zombies enter and as soon as they see you they shamble over.    You’re a little shaken, and you attempt to do exactly what Demar said, but you’re not having any effect. Soon one of the zombies is almost upon you and you lash out with the bone.  You give a few good whacks to the first one’s skull causing it to collapse lifeless once again. You do the same to the second one. You’re breathing hard and thank the fact that they were slow enough not to easily catch you.  However, your victory is short lived, when Demar appears again.  “(Sigh) you killed them, after I told you that was not the purpose. Plus you gave a poor showing in even attempting to control them. I don’t see a future for you, if you cave under pressure like that.”  You’re a little dejected, but the worse is yet to come, when you find you won’t be leaving this place. Mr. Demar can’t risk you knowing about this place yet not being a disciple of his. He didn’t last this long being undetected by taking chances.  With a few quick mumblings and you feel your body ravaged by rot. It’s a horrible death, but one that results in you rising to take the place of the “test” zombies you just ruined.  You spend your remaining undead life shambling around underground until eventually when Demar feels it’s time to attack, you’re one of the first cannon fodder troops to be destroyed in the attempted take over."
7397,4,"You begin to concentrate and prepare for whatever is coming at you. A couple of zombies enter and as soon as they see you they shamble over.  You maintain your calmness and focus, backing up only to get out their reach. It’s not work though, but you refuse to give up so you do something that you never thought you’d ever use.  You’re underground and there are a lot of roots where you’re at, you remember a minor spell you learned in you nature magic class. You cast the spell, and the roots entwine the zombies’ feet causing them to be unable to move at you anymore. You then concentrate on controlling them, which now comes a lot easier to you because you don’t feel in danger anymore.  When you’re sure you have a hold on them, you release the roots and then practice telling the zombies what to do. Sort of fun, like having a pet. Your fun is cut short when Mr. Demar reappears.  “Well, that was an interesting way of handling things. Don’t think I’ve ever seen combining nature magic with necromancy before. Usually the student kills one of the zombies with a fireball or something and then focuses all their attention to control the other one. Still, whatever works, and you are one of the few that’s managed to control the both of them with no training in necromancy at all, so you have natural talent. And natural talent will serve you better for this path.” “I understand why you gave me the test, but I have to say I thought you’d start me off on raising the dead rather than controlling them first.” You say. “Ah! Yes, that’s a common misconception. You want to know why most necromancers fail even before they get started? Because they lack the control. Raising the dead is relatively easy; controlling them takes a great deal more focus and power. Most of the time a neophyte necromancer will go to the local graveyard and end up getting himself killed by the very bodies he raised because he can’t control them. Okay, I think it’s time we introduce you to the rest of the class. We’ll have lots of time to practice while most of the so called regular students are away for vacation.” “Uh, I’m ready, but I was supposed to go visit my family for vacation…and well also I don’t think I’ve passed all my classes either, specifically the nature magic class.” “What? (Sigh) Very well I shall take care of your grade; I know exactly how to handle the situation and I have a lot more pull in this school than most could ever dream of. As for your family members, I’ll leave that up to you. Surely you can think up something to tell them, right?” “Yeah.” “Very well then, it’s all settled. Time to meet the rest of your kind.”  Once again Mr. Demar takes you through another portal. You’re still underground, but now you’re in a more structured setting with actual bricks rather than a cave like setting.  You’re soon introduced to the rest of Mr. Demar’s “class” known as the Dark Order. Some of whom you’ve actually seen on campus or even in your other classes. Those that know you are surprised.  “You’re letting THAT guy in here? I remember him back in Illusion class, and he ended up creating clones that punched the professor in the face!” “That’s nothing, back in Evocation class; he ended up setting the professor on fire.”  “Okay that’s enough class! I can assure you that he has the potential to master the dark arts. He wouldn’t be here if I didn’t think so. Now Trelik and Felsa, you’re coming with me, the rest of you practice your lessons and one of you help our newest associate here get started, we’re all in this together you know.”   After Demar leaves with two of his students, you’re left to your own devices as it seems nobody wants to help you. You look around the study area a bit and you start to pick up one of the many tomes lying around until someone comes up to you.  “Hey, do you even know what those are for?” an ugly student asks you. “Well, they have a skull on the front, and from the looks of them they contain descriptions of various types of undead creature. My guess necromancy.” “Yeah, so what do you know of it?” “Not much, that’s why I’m here obviously, isn’t that why everyone else is?” “Not at all, in fact you’re only the fifth necromancer-to-be here. Most of the students are into studying how to control the infernal planes. You know Demonology. There’s even a guy studying on the lost art of temporal magic.” “Temporal? You mean time?” “Yep, a lot of people forget about that one being outlawed as well. Good reason, considering it could really fuck up something if not used properly. I’d actually stay away from Quayle, I think all that studying on time has made him a little loopy. He tends to talk backwards, and sideways a lot. Even Mr. Demar has a hard time keeping him on track.” “Interesting, so what’s your name, are you a demonologist?” “Me, nope I’m one of the disciples of death as they say. My name’s Sebastian. You might as well meet the others, you’ll be working with.”  Sebastian takes you over to two other students. Catalina and Irwin. They nod at you and go back to their training which involves creating a some sort of bone golem. Catalina looks somewhat familiar. Sebastian tells you the other is Trelik who just left with Mr. Demar.  “He’s the most skilled, besides Mr. Demar of course.” Sebastian says. “So what exactly do I start on first?” you ask. “I’d start out with raising and controlling some skeletons. I know you probably did the zombie thing, but you’ll need to hone your skill a lot and skeletons are easier to practice with. Take this book, and get started. You’ll find the bone pits down the corridor and to the right, don’t go left though; the demonologists got some bad ass demon locked in a circle down there. He’s really pissed off too. Best stay away.”  You take one of the necromantic tomes and head down the corridor. On your way there, you begin to hear a voice penetrating your head.  “You, come here. I know you. You seek power. I can give you that power; you need not waste your time studying anymore. I can grant it to you instantly. You want to be a master of death? Come to me…”  This voice is very tempting."
7397,5,"You feel compelled to follow the voice and you head down the left corridor where eventually you come across a demon sitting in a couched position in a circle. He’s looking at the chalk that creates the circle around him, before looking up at you. He’s a lot bigger and meaner looking than even the demons you’ve met on campus. He certainly doesn’t seem happy to be trapped. You suspect that they summoned this guy up from hell recently.    “Who are you?” “My real name is unimportant, but you can call me Velzix…and you are the new disciple of Demar’s delusional bunch of would be shit starters. They believe that they will be able to take over this school by using the dark arts. And perhaps they may, but such a victory will be fleeting. Mortals lack long term vision. They will not be prepared when the entire world unites against them…but you can be spared that fate. Free me, and I promise you that you will become a powerful force in the struggle ahead.” “While that sound tempting, demons are known for their deceitful nature and infamous for getting around loopholes in so called deals they make.” You say. “Yes, it is something we pride ourselves on…very well I will not harm you when you free me. That is what you worried about isn’t it?” “It had crossed my mind.” “Okay, now you may free me.”"
7397,6,"You easily remove the chalk around Velzix.  “Ah yes, another lack of vision, if they had been smarter they would’ve also placed a magical barrier around the chalk circle and bound me in magic chains. Well, now they shall pay for their arrogance!”  Velzix now free from his prison lets out an unearthly roar and pushes you aside to take revenge on his captors. As you recover and get off the floor, you can already hear the sounds of battle, followed by screams.  You hesitantly head towards the study area, and there you see carnage. The demon has easily killed everyone and is now casting some sort of spell.  “Now that I’m free, this world is going to suffer. That puny mortal Demar’s petty plans pale in comparison in what I have in mind. He’ll be first on the list that I’ll track down. Shouldn’t take long.” He says and opens a portal to the infernal realm where upon several smaller demons come pouring out eager for blood. In fact they see you and begin to step towards you.  “H…hey! You said no harm would come to me!” “I said that I would not harm you. I never said anything about them! Ha ha! Like I said you mortals lack such vision!”  You don’t even have time to run before the demons jump on top of you and begin to rip you to pieces, the only good thing is you were spared the horrors that Velzix unleashed upon the world."
7397,7,"Velzix isn’t pleased that you’re attempting to negotiate with him. He feels he’s given you a fair deal, and he begins to raise his voice at what he considers to be your outrageous demands.  Of course this doesn’t help since it causes some of your fellow students to come wondering what’s going on and hoping Velzix hasn’t escaped.  “Hey! What’re you doing here! You’re not even a demonologist!” one of them yells. “Weak minded fool was probably tempted by Velzix’s voice.” “I’m sure I don’t know what you’re talking about. I never said anything to him, he wandered down here on his own accord, and started talking to me about striking a deal of some kind.” Velzix says with a smile. “I DID NOT!” you protest.  Your protests don’t do too much to help you though. The rest of the students decide you’re either lying, or you don’t have the mental strength to resist the temptations of Velzix. And in either case you’re a liability that they can’t afford.  You’re struck by several lightning bolts and your corpse is completely burned black before you even fall to the ground."
7397,8,"No way, you’re not going down that path. There are too many stories about demons fucking people over in their deals. In fact, you’re a little worried about the fact that this “class” has more dedicated demonologist than necromancers. Still you’ll just have to deal with it for now, you can only hope they know what they’re doing and have a better grasp on things than a certain cabal of wizards did during the Dead War.  As for you, you need to start mastering your own branch of magic. When you get to the pits, you are literally surrounded by bones. You open up your book and begin to read a bit before casting your spell.  Your first attempt isn’t too bad. You animate one skeleton, and surprisingly it doesn’t attack you. You continue to practice this, and while it’s only been an hour, you’ve already animated thirty skeletons, all of which are completely obedient and not attempting to attack you at all.  You’re not sure if this is normal, good or bad for a beginner, but given how many problems you had with other branches of magic, you think you’re doing pretty well. In fact you feel pretty proud of yourself.  You decide to get a little more inventive and you see rusty weapons on the floor along with the bones. You command the skeletons to pick them up and begin to start sparring with each other. They do so, without problems.    This sound of minor battle brings in a few of the students, most of whom are shocked.  “What’s going…whoa. I thought you said you never did this before.” Sebastian says walking in. “I haven’t…I dunno, it’s just coming so easy to me. For the first time I feel like I’m actually good at something!” you say. “Well, it’s a lot better than what you did in Enchantment class when you managed to charm all those frogs which then proceeded to attack the professor.” Catalina says. “That was you? I even heard about that. Man, what is it with you and your spells accidentally hurting your professors in some way?” Irwin adds.  You ignore Irwin’s question, and address Catalina. “I thought I remembered you from somewhere. I asked you out once.” “Hmm, yes and you were unsuccessful in that as well. I suggest you stop looking at me and pay attention to your little army there, before they get out of hand. Like that one.”  You turn around and stop one of the skeletons that’s wandering in your direction and then command him to go back to sparring.  “Man, I’ve never seen someone with this much control just starting out. Well Trelik comes to mind, but he was already very skilled in general magic and was learning directly under Mr. Demar. From what others have said, you were completely inept at magic and have no previous training in this stuff whatsoever. You’re like an idiot savant of necromancy or something.” Sebastian says. “Um…thanks. I think.” “Well anyway, glad you’ve joined up. We’ll leave you be. If you want to try something harder, there’s more tomes in the study area and just ask one of us where the other practice centers are.”  And so it goes. You find your place among the Dark Order and practice your skills there, in fact it gets to the point that you rarely leave the secret underground base at all. You begin to catch the attention of Mr. Demar who is very impressed with your ability to learn and master so quickly. “Natural” isn’t the word for it, more like prodigy. Trelik however is showing signs of jealousy…  Mr. Demar has to tell you to take a break every now and then or else you’ll drain yourself. You don’t feel that way though, you feel like you have more energy than ever.  As he promised your grades were “fixed” though Mr. Demar’s actions meaning you don’t get kicked out of the college. You tell your parents that you’re taking an advanced course in magic that requires you to stay and how you’re really excited about it. Your Mom is a little disappointed that she won’t see you, but is happy to hear that you’re doing so much better in school.  If she only knew…  The City of Nuro is a quieter place with less students around, but the guise of secrecy still must be kept. After a month has passed you find out that this “class” aren’t the only allies Mr. Demar has. He’s been teaching the dark arts for years and most of his “graduates” are living in this city. The attack is going to come when classes first start up again. Demar feels that it will actually be more beneficial to attack with more people in the city because after the demons are done with the killing, the Necromancers can raise the dead to reinforce the hold on the city.  One key part in all of this is Quayle. He is to cast a slow spell of the greatest proportions over the city. While everyone else is moving at a near stand still, the Dark Order will be able to take over key locations much easier.  While all of this sounds exciting you can’t help but still be concerned about this plan. Mr. Demar is placing most of his faith in the demonologist, which you suppose is understandable given his background in conjuration, but you feel as if you necromancers are getting put on the backburner. Sure you’re playing your part, but it almost seems as if you’re just there as “back up”. Not to mention you’re still not keen on the whole idea of dealing with so many demons.  Of course these concerns are the least of your problems as another month goes by, Trelik is becoming a complete asshole to you. Within the short time you’ve been here, he’s time and time again attempted to sabotage your spells, but usually you manage to overcome.  You’ve got a month to go before the final plans are in place, but suddenly Mr. Demar has some news he’s not pleased to inform everyone of.  “Class, we’ve got a delegate from the Vampire Clans. I don’t think I have to tell you how annoying this is.”  You ask Sebastian what’s the problem and what exactly is going. Sebastian tells you that ever since the clans heard about Demar’s plans, they’ve been strongly opposed to them for they fear that it will draw attention to their one last stronghold which is kept invisible and secret to the rest of the world. It is there where the last of the “ruling” class vampires still exist, most of them having been killed or degenerated into little more than mindless beasts that are eventually hunted down.  While you’re fascinated by Sebastian’s explanation of things, you’re suddenly singled out by Trelik.  “YOU! Do you find this so unimportant that you feel the need not to pay attention?” “No. I just didn’t know the whole situation and I was asking…” “If you wanted more information you should’ve been asking Mr. Demar after he was done talking!” “Okay, okay. That will do Trelik. Someone should’ve explained it to him before actually, given that he’ll be playing a large part in this plan. In fact, maybe he should come with me to meet the delegate instead.” “But Mr. Demar! I have more experience in this sort of thing!” “True, but to be quite honest, the blood suckers don’t care too much for you. You’re too combative. So how about it? Do you wish to be present when I speak to this delegate?”"
7397,9,"“Sure I’ll go.” “Very well, you and Felsa are coming with me. Trelik, you go brush up on the attack strategy.” “But!” “No buts! Just do it!”  Trelik storms off while you, Mr. Demar and Felsa head towards the conference room. When you arrive, you see a single pale emaciated figure. He doesn’t look at all like the vampires you’ve heard of in past. There is no regality here.    “It’s about time you showed up. I must confess I was not enthused about you leaving me here waiting like a dog. We have very important matters to discuss!” he hisses. “My apologies Yolev. I just needed to take care of a few things. Please sit, and let us all discuss this.” “There really is no discussion Mr. Demar! You are to cease your plan immediately lest you face the full brunt of the vampire clans! Your foolish mortal desires will kill us all and we cannot allow that to happen! We must continue to survive!” “Survive? Is that all you vampires worry about anymore? Why at one time you were secret rulers and puppet masters. Hell, without you the Great Lich Lord wouldn’t have made nearly as much progress as he did.” “And THAT folly of those ignorant vampires is exactly why we must stop you now. The Dead War cost us greatly, we should not have thrown our lot in with a mad man who was determined to bring death to the world. It was only at the last minute that the wiser of us realized to do so would be detrimental to us. Almost too late. We are only a shadow of our former selves, but that shadow is still long…and we can make life difficult for you.” Yolev warns. “I don’t respond well to idle threats, but I will say this, your fears are unfounded. The Dark Order is not seeking to bring death to the world, we are merely going to reestablish the proper order of things. The strong were meant to rule, and WE are the strong. Those who master the dark arts have always been strong. It is why we are so feared and hated and hunted. You should not be against us Yolev. You should see this as an opportunity to reestablish your rightful place as vampires.”  Mr. Demar’s words have a slight effect on Yolev. He falls silent and looks almost wistful of ancient times, when his kind roamed more free in civilization, rather than hiding and cowering on the outskirts like animals. He quickly snaps out of it though.  “Idealistic words, Mr. Demar, but even if we were still to use what little influence we still have, I cannot believe that you and a few students can change the world. Even if you manage to take this one city, you can’t believe that you’ll get away with it. You there! You’re one of these students are you not? What do you think? And tell me what you TRULY think, not what Mr. Demar wants you to think.” Yolev points to you.  “Well uh…I think we can do it.” You stutter off guard. “…You think you can do it? Is that all you have to say about it? This is what you’re working with Mr. Demar? How could we ever place any faith in your plan when you’re training near idiots that can barely form sentences?” “Yolev, you might be a delegate, but you best watch your tone, you’re not in the best position right now, and given your previous threats you’re already treading on dangerous ground.” “You dare to threaten ME? I’ve crushed greater men AND women than you!” “Yeah, and now you’re a running lap dog for some so called vampire king who rules over nothing but a few remaining scraps of a dying legacy.”  As this begins to get hostile, you notice Felsa preparing to cast something.  You think that if you say anything, things are only going to get worse, so you stand back and do nothing, but hostilities don’t cease and eventually Felsa casts a blast of fire at Yolev, he falls to the floor trying to beat out the flames, but Demar isn’t pleased.  “FELSA! WHY DID YOU DO THAT!?” he shouts and then finishes off Yolev by casting some sort of spell that causes his chest to explode. Two Imps suddenly appear and begin to rip Yolev apart before he can get a chance to recover.  “The pair of you really fucked up today! You with your actions and you with your bumbling! I might as well had Trelik with me! Shit! (Sigh) Alright. Fine we can still do this, but the vampires are going to be pissed off at us now for killing their delegate and it’s definitely going to make things harder. Come on we got a lot to prepare for.”  The last month is no picnic. Mr. Demar has you all training a lot harder than you have before. He’s been pushing everyone a lot harder to the point that they’re getting tired and sloppy. One of the demonologists gets eaten by a brimstone beast. Another accidentally casts a spell backwards and causes himself to be sucked into the infernal realm. Morale isn’t exactly the highest.  But the plan goes through and after the first week classes go back in session, the gates of hell are literally opened. Portals appear all over various parts of not only the campus, but also the city. Demons come swarming out of the portals gleefully killing all in their path. The demonologist lead the attack, while you and the other three necromancers take advantage of all the new corpses in the area. Soon, you have a fair sized army of dead. Mr. Demar himself is taking on the head professors at the college, with the help of Felsa and Trelik. Given the amount of explosions you’re seeing from the streets, you’re glad you got a “lower” assignment.  All seems to be going well until it looks like the demons have decided to leave the city limits, one of the demonologists tries to corral them back shouting that they are supposed to only concentrate on Nuro, but they laugh and simply say: “You didn’t mention that in the deal!”  With the demons completely unreliable now, it’s up to you necromancers to take up the slack. You do alright, but there’s still a lot of resistance and something has gone wrong with Quayle’s spell as your attackers are beginning to move at a normal rate instead of a slower one.  You don’t see this ending well, unless something changes quick. Even if you win, you know you got a shit load of problems ahead of you."
7397,10,"Victory isn’t beyond your grasp, you just need to regroup and organize. You immediately seek out Irwin, Sebastian and Catalina.  You find Sebastian and Catalina, and they’re running low on viable corpses.  “Hey, glad you could get here, the Nuro mage guards are putting up a hell of a fight! The demonologists can’t keep the demons in line and whatever former graduates Mr. Demar had to help us are probably all dead by now!” Sebastian explains. “Yeah, it’s bad all over. Where’s Irwin?” you ask. “Irwin? He’s dead; can’t you see his body lying over there with all the arrows in it?” Catalina points out. “Well, no point in letting this go to waste, we need all the help we can get.” You say and command Irwin to rise to join the rest of the horde  You tell Catalina and Sebastian to hand control over the rest of their troops to you, as if you can concentrate them with a single mind, you’ll be able to break the doors down of city hall and take out the remainder of the mage guards holding out there. You also tell them that one should head back to the college itself and go check on Quayle, and the other should go help out Mr. Demar.  Oddly enough Sebastian and Catalina obey your orders immediately. You begin to feel even more confident in your power of command. You proceed to tell your now larger undead horde to attack the last bastion of Nuro’s governmental control. You unleash blasts of dark energy at the mage guards who attempt to defend from the windows while your zombies and skeletons break down the doors and begin to massacre all those inside.    You enter the building nearly oblivious to the carnage. You feel a very real sense of calming peace amongst the death. Eventually you encounter the “First Citizen” of Nuro busily trying to slay as many of your soldiers as possible, but as you continue to raise them, even he realizes it’s a futile endeavor.  A skeleton warrior hacks his arm off with an axe, and then a recently raised mage guard clubs him in the head with a small mace. He falls to the floor of his own office before your feet and looks up at you.  “Why? You…you’ll never get away with this…” he sputters as he bleeds out. “You might be right, but it’ll be interesting to see if I do.” You calmly say and kick him in the face before another skeleton lands a killing blow to him. He is then raised to join the ranks.  You exit the building and notice that the city is near empty. At least as far as the living go. The dead however are plentiful, bodies litter the streets. More resources for you, you think.  A demonologist looking very worn from battle sees you and you have to stop your small horde from attacking.  “Hey hold on! I’m on your side! Shit, this didn’t turn out as planned, did it?” “Oh I dunno, we got the city.” “Yeah, but Mr. Demar is still battling the rest of the staff in the college and I’m really worried about what the hell’s going on with Quayle’s spell, I don’t know if you’ve experienced it yet, but I’ve been seeing buildings phase in and out of existence. I knew fucking around with time would be trouble!” “Where are all of the demons?” you ask. “Most of them left! I mean there’s a few that stuck around, most of the weaker variety. There was a major demon called Velzix who was supposed to be helping, but he took off as well. Bah! Unreliable lot they are. I should’ve done what you did, become a necromancer! The dead always obey.” “Not always…but you may still fulfill your wish after all this is over, so where exactly are Mr. Demar and Quayle, I mean I know they’re in the university, but where exactly?” “You can’t miss either one of them, Quayle’s located in east section of campus, where you see all the damn buildings phasing in and out. As for Mr. Demar, well I’m sure you can still hear the explosions. I’m going to try to corral at least some of the imps and help Mr. Demar, I’m not going anywhere near the eastside of the campus though. I’m off!”  The demonologist runs to go do what he said, leaving you with a couple choices of proceeding. You could go try to fix this problem with Quayle since it won’t do anyone any good if the city collapses on itself or disappears to gods know where, of course you don’t know exactly what you’re going to do, hell you’ve never even spoken to Quayle before. He was always kept locked up by himself in his room studying most of the time.  Of course you could go help Mr. Demar, chances are he could solve the problem with Quayle a lot better if he survives."
7397,11,"Mr. Demar is a powerful wizard and he’s already got help, along with the help you sent and also the help that’s coming. You need to do something about this time problem.  When you get to the east campus, the demonologist was right, you see a lot of weird things going on, nearby plants are growing older and younger before your eyes, buildings are indeed disappearing and reappearing. It’s a mess. You see Catalina watching it all in wonder. She looks at you briefly only to acknowledge your presence and then goes back to watching the changing landscape.  “I see you choose to check on Quayle.” You say. “Yeah, I think he’s in that small gray building over there, the only one that seems to be stable. I can’t get to him though, well at least I’m not risking it, I sent some of my troops in there and I watched them either accelerate in rot and disintegrate, or even stranger actually turn back into their living selves until they eventually became babies and then nothing. In fact I’m getting out of here as it only seems to be getting worse. This plan sucks.” Catalina replies. “Well someone’s gotta go in, so I guess I’ll do it. I’ve risked too much already to fail. I suggest you go help Mr. Demar.” you exclaim. “Wow, this whole thing has really made you really authoritative. You’ve come a long way since Enchantment class.” “Yeah well I’ve had a revelation that I’m really good at this necromancy stuff and I won’t be denied my career in it before it’s truly begun.”  You suddenly grab Catalina and kiss her on the lips; she pushes you away and slaps your face.  “What the fuck do you think you’re doing?! Just because you’re not incompetent at one thing, doesn’t automatically mean I’m wet for you!” “Well let me show you I’m not incompetent in two things then!” “Ha ha. Maybe later, like next century. Nice try though. But I will go help Mr. Demar seeing as that would be the best course of action for me. Good luck with the time storm there.”  As you check out Catalina’s ass as she leaves you realize you should be focusing on the task at hand, but it’s just you feel so alive for the first time in awhile as ironic as that may seem given the circumstances.  You begin to employ the same strategy that Catalina did, and you get mostly the same results she did, however you currently have a lot more troops than she, so eventually you manage to map out a safe path to the building she thought Quayle was located in.  Apparently she was right, you see him sitting in one of the auditorium class rooms in a lotus like position on the floor in a trance. A strange white field of energy surrounds him.    “You are the future…there is no future…there are many futures…it’s all so fascinating…” he says in an echoed voice. “Hey Quayle, we pretty much won, you can stop doing whatever it is you’re doing with time now. It’s really starting to mess things up.” “Things have started to get better…they will get worse…they will stay the same, all is relative… how will you proceed…you have decided…” “Uh, yeah. Look Quayle you NEED to stop what you’re doing, the whole fucking city is going to disappear if you don’t, and I don’t want to know where it might end up. So stop this right now!”  As soon as you give this order, a flash of light appears from above Quayle’s head and a bizarre creature with way too many tentacles comes out. Naturally it attacks. You dodge out of the way of its tentacle whip and command what remains of your troops to attack. You don’t know why, but you don’t feel very well in its presence. You feel like you’re about to vomit.  “There are so many things…worse than hell…worse than death…madness…insanity…I must show everyone…I have shown everyone…I have lost…I have won…”  Quayle’s either gone completely mad, or he’s speaking perfect sense. Probably both, but either way if this one creature is any indication of what he’s talking about, you’ll have to stop him, but you’re having a really hard time concentrating as strange thoughts begin to enter your mind. You see all manner of images from the past and the present…you dare say the future. It’s all going so fast though and you’re getting dizzy."
7397,12,"You attempt to concentrate, but as you do so another strange creature appears and smacks you in the face, knocking you to the ground. You don’t even have time to recover before it begins to wrap one of its powerful tentacles around your head and squeezes until your skull cracks and your brains come leaking out.  Given what is in store for the world, you were lucky to be killed so quickly."
7397,13,"The tentacle creature has almost killed all your troops, you’re too dizzy to cast a spell, you need to just bum rush this fool.  You run towards the front of the class where he sits and just narrowly dodge another tentacle beast appearing suddenly in front of you.  “…stop…stop it…you must stop…”  You tackle Quayle and something completely unexpected and disgusting happens. His body literally breaks like a fragile glass vase and all manner of insects and maggots come crawling out, mostly on you.  “EEEEYEEECAAAGH!” you yell trying to get them all off of you, completely ignoring anything else. Fortunately for you, whatever you did has stopped the temporal disturbance. The creatures disappear and everything else seems to go back to normal.  After stomping on some centipedes you notice Quayle’s head has rolled into a corner. Surprisingly it’s still alive.  “Thank you…you are the future…perhaps…” his head says before it just simply disappears.  You shake your own head at all of this. As much as you’ve seen during your time in the Dark Order, you’ve never seen anything like this! And you hope never to again. You’re still a little shaken. You take a breather while your few remaining troops wander about, but still obediently awaiting your orders.  You can’t hear anymore explosions; you wonder if Mr. Demar has won, you hope he has, considering you’ve been doing a lot for the “cause” so to speak. You exit the building and begin to walk over to the other side of the campus where the explosions were coming from.  You’re a little tired, but you feel like you might have to be ready for anything, so you raise more of the dead to protect you for possible battle. It’s almost so easy now; you barely need to concentrate even in this fatigued state.  You arrive to burning buildings and ruins of towers. Once again you see Catalina standing outside talking to a demonologist. After they leave, Catalina sees you and once again seems unimpressed by you. You think you’re warming up to her.  “Huh, took you long enough. You missed all the major battle while you were playing around with Quayle.” “Playing around? You don’t even want to know what I’ve been through, and I’ll wager it wasn’t nearly as…disturbing as what you went through.” “Doubt it, by the time I got here Mr. Demar had already lost Felsa, Trelik had betrayed him, and Sebastian was killed. Luckily I was here to provide back up for the final battle with the Dean. We’ve won, but Mr. Demar is very weak right now, I dunno if he’s going to survive his wounds.” “Shit, sounds like I did miss a lot, so is Trelik dead?” “Nope, the coward ran off when he realized he couldn’t beat Mr. Demar.” “Can I see him?” “Sure I guess, he’s in library, or what’s left of it.”  You enter the library briefly remembering when you came in here to seek more necromantic knowledge. Now you have more than you could’ve ever imagined. You see Mr. Demar sitting at a table looking through a book while he winces in pain while clutching his stomach. He’s bloody, as well as burned. He’s a mess.  “(Sigh) This didn’t turn out the way I planned at all. Of course those that follow the dark path never seem to get their way. I wonder why. Is it simple arrogance or is it just the cosmos balancing things out?” he says not looking up. “Mr. Demar, those wounds, you really should…” “I know what my mistake was, I was thinking too big. I should’ve concentrated on one dark art. Spread my attention too thin, and this mess was the result. (Cough) Thought I was going to rule it all…” “Your wounds are…” “Ah fuck it; I knew what I was getting into when I started along this path. I have no regrets other than trusting Trelik. Treacherous bastard. Heed my words, this path is not one of trust. You are truly alone. No matter how powerful you get, there’s always someone seeking to topple you and steal what you have.” “Mr…”  Mr. Demar now addresses you directly.  “Listen to me; this is your last lesson. At least from me, because for what lies ahead of you will be the greatest test of all. You’re obviously a powerful necromancer, and you’re only going to become more so. You must take advantage of your powers, and do everything you can to survive and crush those who oppose you. If that means war so be it, but if you can achieve this through peace do not be so quick to dismiss it. Chances are this will not be an option for you, but anything is possible. Just never back down. You are a ruler, not a subject. The city is yours if you can hold on to it. The entire world is yours…if you can hold on to it…”  Mr. Demar collapses on the table. Strange that someone so powerful chose to die, since you get the impression his death could’ve been prevented with some strong healing magic. Did he feel that he failed and death was what he deserved? Was he deep down too cowardly to handle the hardship ahead? Or was he just tired?  You’ll never know for certain you suppose. You exit the library, where Catalina meets you.  “So what’s going on?” she asks. “I’m in charge, that’s what’s going on.” You reply.  Catalina looks surprised at the bluntness and simplicity of your answer.  “Well, I suppose we could do worse…so what’s next fearless leader?” “Good question.”"
7397,14,"Chapter 3: One Foot In The Grave  One year has passed…  It’s hard to believe it, but it’s been a year since you took control of Nuro…or rather Aftermath as you renamed it.  The “Nuro Incident” as it came to be known was a shock to the civilized world. Nobody had anticipated such a thing occurring despite all preparations. Certainly not to Nuro given it’s near “invincible” reputation.  The Grand Alliance was immediately formed to retake the city, but fortunately for you, you weren’t the only problem they had.  Velzix, a demon lord who soon left Nuro during its attack, managed to unite the rest of the demons that felt the need to break their contract with the Dark Order turned their attention to the Tulan Kingdom. Right now he’s established his own rule, enslaving the population and is most likely planning further conquest assuming he can keep his own troops from fighting each other long enough.  Trelik the “other necromancer” has been rampaging across the countryside in a vain attempt to establish some sort of dominion of his own, but so far without any real allies he’s yet to be successful. His actions have still kept the Grand Alliance and other governments busy however.  As for you, you’ve already managed to hold off one Grand Alliance attack quite successfully due to your preparations. The first thing you did was command all the surviving Dark Order members to become necromancers. Some of them the more die hard demonologists hated this idea, so you gave them the option of taking their chances with Velzix or alone against the Grand Alliance.  After being presented with these two undesirable prospects, they grumbled, but the rest soon fell in line. Catalina was mainly responsible for training them, given that she’s the only other “true” necromancer in the city. You’re glad of that as it saved you from having to do everything.  Your relationship with Catalina’s has improved mainly because you’ve proven yourself to be a competent leader that has managed to hold on to the city despite the odds. She still acts like she’s not interested in you, but you catch an extended glance from her every now and then. Oh yeah she’s definitely warming up to you.  You haven’t heard anything from your family, you can only wonder what they think of all this and in some ways you don’t want to know.  While things are somewhat quiet now, that’s not going to last. The Grand Alliance will keep attacking and who knows how long they’ll be distracted with Velzix and Trelik? They may very well overwhelm you in time, if the other threats are taken care of. You can’t just sit in your throne room and prepare for the next attack; you’ll need to be proactive about this threat.  This of course this means conquest. Your standing army is stronger than ever right now and your powers in necromancy have grown considerably with the last year. You’re confident that you could probably take over a small kingdom. Gaining more territory that your enemy can’t use is usually a good way of making things harder for them."
7397,15,"Ah the time honored the tradition of all true rulers…  “Catalina, I think it’s time we expand.” You say walking into her study. “Oh you do, do you? Well, there’s no shortage of places. Got somewhere in particular in mind?” “A few places, but this is sort of why I’m talking to you, I figure it’ll be good to have your input.” “Wow, laying it on thick today aren’t we?” “Yeah…do you like it?” “Maybe.” She says with a faint smile. “Good, but seriously I’m thinking we should attack the Brot Kingdom. It’s close, and its military is weak.” “Normally I’d agree, but I think you’re forgetting that our former classmate Trelik has currently established a presence there.” “Yeah, I was thinking we could get rid of him at the same time.” “Easier said than done I hope you realize. I know he’s a treacherous asshole that’s been run ragged by the Grand Alliance, but that doesn’t mean he’s any less formidable. Not to mention we’ll still have the Brot military to handle and hopefully the Grand Alliance doesn’t show up in the area. Speaking of which, Trelik’s pitiful endeavors have been keeping them busy. Get rid of him and they’ll pay more attention to us.” “Alright then, where do you think we should attack?” “Here.”  Catalina points to a rather barren area known as the Drozz Wasteland which contains barbaric orc tribes, though ogres, goblins and similar “uncivilized” races dwell there as well.  “What the hell are we supposed to do with that?” “Do you realize how many soldiers we can get in that area? The tribes in there are disorganized and unlikely to give us a meaningful fight. We can suffer minimal losses and gain more than what we started out with. Then we can use those gains against more formidable foes!” “Cat baby, THAT is not going to be easy. First of all I know something of orcs and the green bastards don’t know when to fucking quit most of the time. Even with the fear of an undead army, I guarantee they’ll still fight. Same thing with the ogres, trolls, minotaurs and GIANTS that live in that area! Giants, Catalina. Fucking giants. Not to mention those tribes have the full advantage of the knowledge of the terrain.” “What difference does that make? It’s not like our army needs to eat or even sleep! Those tribes are fighting each other most of the time too. By the time we’ve slaughtered half of those mongrel tribes, it’s still unlikely that the rest will unite against us in any meaningful way. You said giants live there and perhaps that will be a challenge, but think about it, we could RAISE those same giants to use against our enemies in the future!”  While the idea of raising undead giants is appealing, you still have reservations about attacking the area.  You have a big decision to make."
7397,16,"As much as raising undead colossuses would be cool, you decide that taking over the Brot Kingdom will be easier and you’ll be able to take out Trelik at the same time.  “I think I’ll go with my plan of attacking the Brot Kingdom.” “You just want to be all macho and kill Trelik.” “Maybe…does it turn you on?” “Ha ha. Perhaps if you’re successful. Are you going to do this personally?” “Of course, I don’t think any of the other necromancers can take on Trelik by themselves, and I’d rather have you here looking after things.” “Really? You’re trusting me to run Aftermath?” “Yeah, now I want you to keep a good run of things here, and if the Grand Alliance attacks I want to know immediately, so I can get here!” “Okay, but I doubt if that’ll happen. I’d be more concerned with them attacking you when you’re at the Brot Kingdom.” “I’ll be fine, okay I’m off.” “Good luck!” she says and quickly kisses you on the cheek before you leave. You stare at her for a moment in shock and she stares back.  “What?” she asks as if nothing happened. “Nothing, but we’ll discuss THAT later when I return.” You say. “Maybe. If you’re good and return victorious.” “I don’t think I’ll be good, but I will be returning victorious.”    You decide to take a couple of extra necromancers with you for support as you march your undead horde towards the Brot Kingdom. By the time you get there you can see the destruction that Trelik has wrought. It’s obvious where he’s been. Some corpses linger around the razed towns he’s obviously been through, but you immediately bring them under your control. It’s apparent that Trelik hasn’t focused on fortifying his holdings too much and he probably wasn’t expecting you to arrive at all.  Given his weakened state, you wonder if you should bother attacking Trelik immediately. Perhaps you should take out the remaining Brot military just to get them out of the way first seeing as they might be more of a threat."
7397,17,"Your thirst to get rid of one of your rivals overcomes you and he is closer, so you continue your march towards where he’s located, it doesn’t take long as you just follow the heavier population of undead wandering around. You continue to easily take control of his unsupervised troops.  At last you reach the heart of his domain, where you are less able to take control of his undead and you’re forced to destroy them. You catch sight of each other during the battle.  “You! You’re the cause of my current problems! It should’ve been me to take Nuro! That’s all gonna change today though! You were a fool to come here, you should’ve stayed behind your safe walls!”  While Trelik is ranting at you, you choose to take a more active approach and blast him with a beam of negative energy. He falls and temporarily loses control of his undead. You take advantage of it and enforce your own will over them. Trelik’s position isn’t good considering he’s surrounded.  “NO! Don’t follow him, follow me! You’re supposed to follow me! NOOOOO!” are his last words before he’s butchered by his once obedient corpses.  “All too easy, now let’s finish off the Brot military and take over this place completely.” You remark.  Taking Trelik’s remaining army you march upon the heart of the Brot Kingdom. The place is better defended than you thought, but your numbers are overwhelming and you don’t have to worry about Trelik being at your back. You conquer the Brot Kingdom within a period of a few days. A Grand Alliance army attempts to retake your conquests within the week, but you’ve fortified your position by then and successfully defeat them.  You leave a few of your most competent necromancers in charge and return to Aftermath in triumph. Catalina meets you.  “So, what’s the update?” “I killed Trelik, I conquered the Brot Kingdom, then I kicked the Grand Alliance’s asses.” You say putting your arm around her. She’s not resisting anymore. “Hmm, sounds like you were very victorious. So now what?” “Now what? You and me in the bedroom, that’s what!”  You and Catalina at last end this little dance and consummate your relationship.  And just think all it took was destruction and killing on a grand scale!  Four years pass…  It’s been five years since you took control of Aftermath and you’ve made progress. Though not much. Many changes have certainly have come about.  Your territory now encompasses a little more than just Aftermath, but besides the former Brot Kingdom, your other holdings are minor towns that dot the landscape. You call your region the Dead Dominion. The population consists mainly of the dead, with necromancers typically being the only living beings, though there are pockets of living that have pledged their loyalty to you in exchange for mercy. You have granted it. You and Catalina are now truly King and Queen of the dead.  Velzix has benefited a little from your success; he’s managed to hold on to his own realm, but has failed to expand. While he’s stilling having problems of his own, rumors are that he’s attempting to rip open a portal of the largest size to unleash all of the horrors the infernal plane has to offer.  The Grand Alliance is attempting to handle the pair of you, but has only succeeded in fighting to a stalemate. Rumors are the Zalan Empire is attempting to take full control over the Grand Alliance in order to pursue a more extreme course of action.  You have not heard anything from you family. You know your Dad’s mercenary company has been fighting in the outskirts of Velzix’s realm. Your sister has become a respected and successful Grand Alliance captain. She’s managed to hold back the tide of your dead horde from gaining anymore ground for a couple years now. As for your Mom, who knows? You’d prefer not to know what she thinks of you.  You aren’t making anymore progress. You’ve expanded as much as you’re able without making yourself vulnerable. You know you’re going to have to do something soon, but allying with Velzix isn’t an option. Making peace with the Grand Alliance isn’t either.  The Vampire Clans have unsuccessfully sent assassins after you, but they have all failed. However one night you are visited by another vampire who you almost kill before he begs and insists that he has a message for you from the Clans. He states that they are willing to talk to you. He says he can take you to their secret fortress. That is the only area where Lord Rostov will agree for any types of negotiations to take place.  At this point you’re open to the possibility of peace talks if it’ll reduce the number of enemies you have, though Catalina is wary of this."
7397,18,"Catalina’s right, you can’t take the chance of trusting these bloodsucking bastards. If they get you in their fortress, that’s going to be it for you.  “I regret to inform you, but your trip here has been wasted and so has you existence.” You say as Catalina sets him ablaze with a fireball and you cause his heart to explode.  “Wow, that was oddly familiar.” You reply and then order the remains to be cleaned up before going about your business again.  Indeed it was very familiar since you were witness to Mr. Demar and Felsa doing a similar thing to delegate Yolev five years ago. And much like those two, you’ve set yourself on a course that will end badly like it did for them.  Five years pass…  It’s been ten years since you took control of Aftermath and now it looks like that’s all finally coming to an end.  Velzix never quite managed to succeed in his plan to open up the portal, and was struck down by your Dad’s mercenary company of all things. Your Dad died during the battle and he was declared a hero who sacrificed all in the cause of good. A statue of him now stands in the Zalan Empire’s capital. Funny how mad men can be made into heroes so easily  With no other enemies the Grand Alliance turns its full attention to you and they’re relentless with your sister leading them. She manages to take back everything you ever conquered until at last she’s at the gates of Aftermath itself.  You defend her attacks many times and you only grow weaker each passing day. However, it is not your sister that kills you. It is by another group of vampire assassins who once again slip in under the cover of night.    You’re no longer able to fight them effectively due to all the energy you’ve been expending fighting your sister’s army outside. Catalina is dispatched first when she attempts help you, when you see her fall; you gain a surge of adrenaline and manage to kill one of the assassins. You wound another severely, but ultimately they strike you down and only a bloody mess is left for your sister to find when she finally breaks down the gates of Aftermath."
7397,19,"You figure that this is worth the chance, so you agree, but Catalina is staying behind. The messenger says that only you were invited anyway so that is not a problem.  “Are you sure about this?” Catalina asks you. “Not really, but I’m not too sure about our future…I mean I know we’re doing okay now, but I get the impression that it’s only a matter of time. If dealing with Lord Rostov can help us, then I gotta try.”  Catalina nods and kisses and hugs you goodbye before you and this messenger go teleporting off to the secret Vampire Clan fortress. He pulls out a black cube, presses a button and you both are immediately in the throne room of Lord Rostov. You still have no idea where this place is, but you’re surrounded by several vampires. Some of which have a regal look about them as opposed to the hideous appearance that most of them have nowadays.  Lord Rostov gets up from his seat and greets you.  “Ah, the necromancer. You’ve been causing quite a bit of trouble I hear. The Grand Alliance has had many problems with you, though those should be coming to an end soon I should think.” “Because you’re gonna kill me?” you ask, expecting trouble. “Hmm, that’s a rather blunt assumption, but I suppose a possible one. However, that need not be the case. That is why I have called you to talk.” “Okay I’m listening.” “Yes. What I’m offering is for you to give up your mad plan of murdering the world in exchange for immortality.” “…what?” “I’m saying if you give up your plan, you may stay here and become one of us.”  You don’t really know what to say at this point.  “…I don’t know what to say…I mean why would you offer this?” “Ah, a valid question. Well, as you know we’ve been monitoring you. So far you’ve outlasted far longer than you should have, showing that you are a survivor and a man who can thrive under pressure. I personally respect such traits. You would be a fine addition to the clans and quite frankly I wouldn’t mind having someone new to talk to. Trust me these lot haven’t said anything interesting for a LONG time.” Lord Rostov says dismissively to his silent court. “While your offer has some appeal, I still don’t know. I mean…” ”Why the hesitation? You are a necromancer, is not immortality not your ultimate goal? And this is the only way you’re going to achieve it my friend, for even if I choose to let you go, you will not last too much longer out there. As I speak the Grand Alliance will be pursuing a more efficient way to deal with you and that ignorant demon Velzix. I’m sure you’re aware that we do have influence over the mortal world and we are setting things up to defend the status quo. A demonic playground and a graveyard are unacceptable outcomes.” “I understand that, but you keep saying that I’m going to murder the world. I don’t necessarily have any desire to do that. I mean I’ve been just trying to defend myself for the most part. If I could live in peace with the civilized nations I wouldn’t be attempting to take anymore territory. In fact I haven’t for a long time. I mean you said you had influence. Couldn’t we just come to an understanding and you pull some strings to get the Grand Alliance to leave me alone?”  Lord Rostov laughs at your proposal.  “Even I cannot do that, even if I chose to do so! The living will always distrust and be repulsed by the undead. They would continue to attack even if we used our influence to cause a change in attitudes and policies. And I would not do so anyway. You are too much of a danger to the world. You claim you do not wish to turn the world into a mass grave, and you may even believe it. But how long really will you be able to contain your nature? You won’t. Just as we cannot contain our nature either.” “Well if you feel I’m so dangerous, why keep me alive at all, let alone turn me into a vampire?” “Because as I have said, you are worthy of such a gift and you would be someone new to talk to. Not to mention if you haven’t noticed, our numbers are no longer what they once were, and they’re even less due to our failed assassination attempts. It would be nice to get them back up again. And if you were to become one of us, your need to kill the entire world would lose its appeal. After all you cannot kill your food supply without killing yourself.” “I guess that’s true.” “Yes. And just think, you’ll still achieve immortality and in a much better form. Do you really want to be a rotting skeletal lich? Also, you can still control the world; we shall always have our hand in guiding the ways of our livestock. That is why we need more of us, so we can once again gain total control over them. You are being offered a better deal than you could ever achieve yourself. What will your answer be?”  Lord Rostov has basically given you an “out” as it were. A rather generous one, almost too generous. You can’t help but think he doesn’t have an angle. Still, he’s making a lot of sense.  “…Catalina…may she join me?” “Ah yes. Your mate. I suppose so. Assuming she wishes to join you. So I take it, you are accepting my offer?” “Yes, yes I am.” “Excellent. You will see that this was the best choice, now you may feel a slight sting…”  Before you know what Lord Rostov means, you are suddenly grabbed from behind and bitten in the neck by a vampiress. You feel your blood drain from your body and soon your life fades completely.  Your heart ceases beating and then you die.  A few hours pass and you rise again. You feel quite different, but definitely stronger. Quicker too. In fact you feel better than ever. Lord Rostov stands by to watch you get up.  “Welcome to your new life, now you may go attempt to convince your mate, but be quick about it, I will have further orders for you.”  You nod and head back to Aftermath where you meet Catalina in your new superior form. She can’t believe it.  “YOU WENT AHEAD AND DID THIS WITHOUT ME?” “No! I was thinking about us the whole time! I mean why do you think I came back for you? We can have it all and we can have it together!” “Yeah, and I’m sure Lord Rostov has offered this gift out of the goodness his rotten heart. Didn’t you think he has a hidden agenda?” “I’m sure he does, but look we can’t fight them in our current state. If we go this route we can possibly be in a position where we can defend ourselves better. We won’t have to worry about the Grand Alliance or any of that anymore.” “Yeah, just a lot of shifty vampires probably all trying to plot against each other.” “True, but if we’re together we can handle it. Come with me Catalina, I want us to be together in this.”  Catalina thinks silently about it for a moment, and then allows you to embrace her where you begin to drain her blood. You feel completely invigorated by doing this, possibly because you have such a strong bond with her. She soon dies and after you wait a few hours, she rises again. She now will remain forever beautiful.  “Are you ready my dear?” “Yes.”  You and Catalina return to vampire fortress via black cube and begin your new lives.  Years pass and things change thanks to the influence of the vampire clans. Influence you played a part in.  Velzix never quite managed to succeed in his plan to open up the portal, and was struck down by your Dad’s mercenary company of all things. Your Dad died during the battle and he was declared a hero who sacrificed all in the cause of good. A statue of him now stands in the Zalan Empire’s capital. Funny how mad men can be made into heroes so easily. Lord Rostov asked if you wanted to have the statue taken down, but you declined. It made your Mom happy.  Your own dominion soon fell into disarray without your guidance. Many necromancers attempted to take your place, but ultimately the Grand Alliance army lead by your sister crushed them all and retook everything that once was under your control.  The status quo is soon restored and the puppet master weavings of the Vampire Clans continue.  You and Catalina will have other journeys during this new life, but your journey as a necromancer is over."
7397,20,"You march your horde toward the heart of the Brot Kingdom where Trelik hasn’t been yet. You find that it’s a little better defended than you thought. They have mustered up all their remaining hero types to lend their hand to the defense.  It takes a week before you manage to even reduce the Brot Kingdom to shambles and knocking on their capital gates. This probably would’ve went quicker however, had Trelik not been launching his own attacks at your back and stealing some of your troops.  Another week passes and you finally complete your attack on the Brot Kingdom. You manage to drive off Trelik, but fail to kill him. You also end up having to fend off a Grand Alliance attack which further weakens you.  Your resources are stretched out and you’ve lost many of your necromancers to help support a large army. It’s draining much of your energy just to maintain your defenses. You send a message to Catalina asking if there’s anyway to get reinforcements, but she replies that doing so would be unwise as the Grand Alliance has sent another army on the way to Aftermath.  You decide to maintain a skeleton crew as it were in the Brot Kingdom and head back to Aftermath post haste. You arrive just in time to defend Aftermath, which you do successfully…barely. At this point you’re running on empty and you have to rest to recharge yourself. All of this has been a greater ordeal than you thought and it’s only going to get greater.  Four years pass It’s been five years since you took Aftermath, and you’ve made little progress. In fact you sense the end is near and you’ll be happy about it because this has been a miserable time and you wonder what the hell you were thinking all those years ago when you pursued this path…  When Velzix was finally defeated, the Grand Alliance was able to focus the full brunt of its attention towards you, leaving you in a perpetual state of being on the defensive. Never again were able to attempt another act of conquest and over the years you eventually lost the Brot Kingdom.  Vampire assassins from the clans made multiple attempts on your life. You barely fought them off. The last attack left you horribly scarred; it was only due to Catalina’s sacrifice that you survived. You’ll miss her dedication to you and your time together which was the only good thing about any of this.  You recently received a letter from your family. It’s been so long you’d almost forgotten you had one. It’s your Mom. She begs for you to give yourself up as she doesn’t want your sister to have to fight you in the next Grand Alliance attack, which apparently she’s leading.  Good old Mom, she always did try to protect you from your sister. But not this time. You’re going to carry this through to the end.  You finish up writing your letter back to Mom just as The Grand Alliance has broken down your gates. The cause of “good” has won. You wait for their final arrival in your throne room.  You see your sister approach with her elite guards, she says nothing. Just a look of scorn on her face says it all.  You stand up.  “Let’s do it.” You say and unleash a blast of negative energy and summon ghostly soldiers to defend you.  The fight is furious, but your sister has the cause of righteousness on her side. She eventually reaches you and stabs you through the heart. You look down and tell your sister one last thing.  “…letter…on the desk…take it to Mom…tell her…I’m sorry…”"
7397,21,"Catalina has a way of swaying you to her plan. (She does have experience in enchantment after all) She knew the whole raising undead giants thing would appeal to you! Of course you actually have to kill them first.  “Alright Catalina, we’ll go with this plan, but I’m going to do it personally, so you’re in charge of things here for awhile.” “Really? You’re not only following my advice, but you’re also trusting me to run Aftermath?” “Yeah I’m whipped, now I want you to keep a good run of things here, and if the Grand Alliance attacks I want to know immediately, so I can get here!” “Okay, but I doubt if that’ll happen. They’ve been preoccupied with Velzix lately.” “Hmm, y’know we’ll have to do something about him too later, but first I guess I got some barbarians to kill.” “Good luck!” she says and quickly kisses you on the cheek before you leave. You stare at her for a moment in shock and she stares back.  “What?” she asks as if nothing happened. “Nothing, but we’ll discuss THAT later when I return.” You say. “Maybe. If you’re good and return victorious.” “I don’t think I’ll be good, but I will be returning victorious.”  You decide that given the long stretches of barren plains of where you’re heading. Incorporeal undead shall work better. You need speed, and the tribes will probably have little in the way of magic to combat you. You also take a couple extra necromancers with you along with your army of ghosts, spirits and wraiths.  You make pretty good time and suffer no attacks on the way, probably because of the rather low profile and somewhat hard to see aspects of your army. When you arrive in the Drozz region, it’s night, but still as desolate as you remember it. Your Dad took you here a couple times during his attempts to “toughen” you up when he still thought he could turn you into a warrior. You hated it then, and you hate the place now.  After casting a sense life spell, you start to head towards the direction of the nearest tribe, but your uncanny connection with death lets you know that you’re being watched and not by the living…  Suddenly from over a small hill top a group of misshapened creatures pop their heads up. After what looks to be chatter between the creatures, they lope in your direction. Ghouls. One of the filthier forms of undead. Typically they were created by vampires, who used to use them as tougher servants. (Basically mortals who weren’t “worthy” enough for the gift of vampirism) but that would mean that there’s a vampire in the area.  You don’t have time to think too hard about it, you just react and dominate your will over the ghouls. For some reason they’re very resistant to you and you’re forced to destroy them. More ghouls appear however, and soon you’re surrounded.  “Where the fuck are these things coming from?” one of your necros asks. “Stay calm. Don’t lose control…VAMPIRE! SHOW YOURSELF! If you’re going to assassinate me, I would’ve thought the clans were at least honorable enough to not rely on ghouls!” you shout.  Your shouting is soon answered. The ghouls suddenly stop and a hideous figure appears on the same hilltop. He then walks towards you and your army and stops not to far from it. He’s fearless and shows no signs of being concerned of your presence.    “Clans? Don’t speak to me of the clans! I was cast out long ago for my actions! Once I feasted upon the blood of royalty, with legions of mortals willing to die for me. Now I feast upon the carrion of barbarians with only ghouls as company.” “So you’re an outcast? I thought all you types of vampires degenerated into mindless beasts much like the ghouls.” “Hah! Do you not think this is degeneration enough? I can’t even make another vampire anymore. But you are quite correct. Most of us did. One thing keeps me going though and kept my mind sharp. Revenge. I vowed I would get revenge on the Clans somehow. Of course the reality is, I’ve had to hide in a hole in the ground while my ghouls scavenge the countless battlefields of this accursed place. I am the Ghoul King.” “Ghoul King eh? I’m very surprised nobody’s hunted you.” “I haven’t survived this long by being sloppy. The only ones who tend to be around here are barbarians and if any of them ever see us, it’s their last time. But the tribes tend to be an anti-social lot anyway, so it’s unlikely that any of them run to tell the civilized folks that there are ghouls and their king infesting the area. So what of you? It’s been a long time since I’ve seen a necromancer…a long time…” “I’m attempting to supplement my army as it were. These tribes would make excellent additions. Especially the giants.” “I see. So you mean to take away my food source? Not to mention my OWN supply of followers. These ghouls don’t grow from trees you know!”  This is an interesting situation. You didn’t expect this, but perhaps you can use it to your advantage. This “Ghoul King” is close enough to you to attack with your troops. Chances are, if you killed him, you could take his remaining horde of ghouls to help you destroy the tribes in the area.  However, maybe you could use a little diplomacy."
7397,22,"Why mess around with a middle man, when you can control the ghouls yourself?  You order your troops to attack, at which point the Ghoul King orders his ghouls to do likewise, as he attempts to slaughter his way through your army to get to you!  “Little necromancer, did you really think you could intimidate me? I am still more than a match for a mere mortal!” he mocks as jumps and leaps towards you.  Your troops have no noticeable effect on him. Their draining powers do nothing, though the scythes of the wraiths do some damage. You have to use non-necromantic magic against him and you cast a fireball into his chest.  It’s enough to cause him to leap away from you and attempt to roll out the flame, but he kills two of your necromancers in the process. His ghouls are getting wiped out by your undead, but they’re coming like hordes of lemmings, you have to kill the Ghoul King now.  “Blast the bloodsucker with fire!” you order your last remaining necromancers to do. Fortunately being ex-demonologists, their knowledge of fire magic is still quite strong. The Ghoul King attempts to leap out of the way, but the flame spells still hit him. He runs around burning and howling horribly.  Soon the wraiths put a final end to the Ghoul King with their scythes. The rest of the ghouls seeing their King dead, begin to run away in multiple directions. You manage to easily dominate most of them and corral them into your fold.  Not too bad, though losing a couple of necros wasn’t something you wanted. At least not so early. You press on with your quest to conquer the Drozz tribes.  Weeks turn into months and your campaign there is going…mediocre. You did alright in the beginning, but after awhile the tribes began to unite in a way you didn’t think they would or at least you’d think it would take longer. While mostly low in magic, they had more shaman and witch doctor types than you expected as well. They also know to start targeting you and your other necromancers whenever possible, which has resulted in you being the only one left and supporting the entire undead army. Given how long you’ve been without rest, lack of other magical enhancers, the constant drain and the large number of undead you’re controlling, you could be over exerting yourself.  Your time here hasn’t really been profitable. You’ve gained more troops, but you’ve lost necromancers and you still haven’t really conquered the area. The tribes have been simply moving and hiding around the area.  You wonder if you should cut your losses…"
7397,23,"You’re determined to make Drozz a deadland and you’ll not have these barbarians defy you!  You press on with your attack, now climbing into the more hilly areas of Drozz where most of the tribes have fled to. Things turn worse when they ambush you from higher positions. Witch Doctors use their primitive magic to whittle away your ghostly troops. You’re nearly smashed when hill giants begin throwing boulders at you. Those heavy rocks crush several of your ghouls.  You’re so busy trying to get out of the way of the boulders, you don’t even see the archers on the other side of you. Their arrows strike down the remainder of your ghouls and hit you as well.  You attempt to retreat, but they’ve blocked it off. There’s no escape. Your troops are at last destroyed and you’re on the ground dying from being shot full of arrows. A large orc war chieftain walks slowly over to you with a huge axe in hand. You have no more strength to fight.  “Hur hur, little dead wizard. Da tribes have never tasted defeat and dey never will.” He grunts before bringing his axe down on your head."
7397,24,"A little dejected, you make your way back to Aftermath. Along the way, you come across Trelik who’s looking particularly pathetic. It looks like he’s got his ass handed to him once again by the Grand Alliance. He sees you and your army and runs towards you! You hold back from attacking as this should be interesting.  “Please! Ya gotta help me! I’ve got no where to turn to! The Grand Alliance is unstoppable! They destroyed all of what I had accomplished in the Brot Kingdom! I hear they’re even starting to make progress against Velzix! All around me are hunters! I can’t rest! They’re all out to get me!” he rants while groveling on the ground. He’s badly scarred; he’s even missing a few fingers.  You have no sympathy for this dickhead though, especially not after what you’ve been through. You’re going to enjoy this.  “Pfft! Look at you. Useless. Why would I help a traitorous dog like you who obviously can’t handle pressure?” you say kicking him in the face. He whimpers and begs for his life. “Pah! You wouldn’t even make a good corpse! Ghouls, fulfill your hunger on this waste of flesh!” you shout as the ghouls eagerly follow your orders.  Feeling a little better from hearing Trelik’s screams you continue on your way to Aftermath.  When you get there, things are more or less how they were. Catalina is full of questions, questions that you’re really in no mood to answer.  “So…what happened? No undead giants?” she asks. “No, it was a bad idea, and I never should’ve went there!” “…wait are you blaming ME for this?” “(Sigh) Me blame you? No of course not. Nope it was my own stupidity at work here for following your advice in the first place. Don’t worry, you’re off the hook.” “Y’know maybe it was a good plan and it was your own incompetence that lead to defeat, you ever think of that?” “Watch it Catalina…don’t fucking piss me off right now. The only reason why I’m in a tolerant mood is because I killed that dickhead Trelik on my way home. Damn that felt good.” “Yeah, well I hope you’re in the mood for a fight, because I hear the Grand Alliance is preparing another attack.” “I don’t give a fuck. Just let me know when they get here, and I’ll save this city again like I always do.” You say heading to your study.  And so it happens, the Grand Alliance attacks and just like you said, you successfully defend against them.  Four years pass…  It’s been five years since you took Aftermath, and you’ve made little progress. In fact you sense the end is near and you’ll be happy about it because this has been a miserable time and you wonder what the hell you were thinking all those years ago when you pursued this path…  When Velzix was finally defeated, the Grand Alliance was able to focus the full brunt of its attention towards you, leaving you in a perpetual state of being on the defensive. Never again were able to attempt another act of conquest and over the years you’ve gotten weaker in resources while your enemies have only gotten stronger.  Catalina and you never got along really well after you came back from Drozz. She never saw you as the formidable leader she thought you were, and you blamed her for her idea to go to Drozz (Even though you said you didn’t blame her). The relationship became strained and one day in a particularly heated argument, you struck her down with a powerful blast of negative energy. She died instantly. You apologized to her before ultimately burning her body.  Vampire assassins from the clans made multiple attempts on your life. You barely fought them off. The last attack left you with missing fingers. You remember laughing at the time since they were on the same hand that Trelik was missing his fingers all those years ago.  You recently received a letter from your family. It’s been so long you’d almost forgotten you had one. It’s your Mom. She begs for you to give yourself up as she doesn’t want your sister to have to fight you in the next Grand Alliance attack, which apparently she’s leading.  Good old Mom, she always did try to protect you from your sister. But not this time. You’re going to carry this through to the end.  You finish up writing your letter back to Mom just as The Grand Alliance has broken down your gates. The cause of “good” has won. You wait for their final arrival in your throne room.  You see your sister approach with her elite guards, she says nothing. Just a look of scorn on her face says it all.  You stand up.  “Let’s do it.” You say and unleash a blast of negative energy and summon ghostly soldiers to defend you.  The fight is furious, but your sister has the cause of righteousness on her side. She eventually reaches you and stabs you through the heart. You look down and tell your sister one last thing.  “…letter…on the desk…take it to Mom…tell her…I’m sorry…”"
7397,25,"You can’t say you’ve exactly been entirely enthusiastic about this plan to conquer these tribes. The reality is starting to set in that you’ll never be able to get rid of them all. At least not without a concentrated effort, which would take a lot more time and troops that you’re unwilling to commit at this point.  But The Ghoul King could help. He most likely knows the lay of the land just as well as the tribes, and considering he lives here, he can dedicate as much time as he wants.  “Very well Ghoul King I have no wish to take what is yours. I shall leave in peace if you’ll permit.” You say respectfully. “Hmm, I had not expected you to respond that way. Perhaps though you have yet another trick up your sleeve?” “No trick. But perhaps a proposal.” “Diplomacy? Are you serious? I have rarely ever encountered a necromancer ready to discuss anything so calmly before. You are a rare breed. Okay, what’s your proposal? I have to know just because you’ve managed to surprise me, twice today.” “My proposal is an alliance.” “An alliance? For what purpose? I imagine that you’re being hounded by the civilized world. Why would I bring such troubles on myself?” “Because I’m your best shot at revenge. You said you’ve wanted revenge on the Vampire Clans, well I’m not exactly on their good side either. Eventually I’m going to have to deal with them. Look at you, you said it yourself. You’ve been forced to hide out from the world in a hole in the ground. Wouldn’t you at least like that to change? Even if you die, at least you can say you tried! Changes ARE coming to this world, and this is your chance to be on the winning side.”  The Ghoul King looks in the sky. His expression reminds you of delegate Yolev’s when Mr. Demar gave him a chance to join. You hope you have more success.  “I have been told such promises before; a long time ago…this state that you see before you is what it got me. However, there’s no fool like an old one. What more can be done to me? I’ve lost all as it is, I can only gain. I’m listening more to your proposal, but let’s have some details. I won’t ally with someone that’s as foolish as me.”  You quickly explain that the Ghoul King should attack the tribes like he’s been doing, but to just increase the frequency. All you ask is that he leave a portion of the dead for you (rather than eating them) to use as troops. You will leave one of your necromancers here as an emissary and transporter as it were.  The Ghoul King finds this arrangement to be acceptable. He laughs when you say you would also like it if he managed to kill some giants for you to raise. He says he’ll see what he can do and as an act of goodwill he allows you to have a sizable amount of his ghouls.  “I can always make more!”  You return to Aftermath feeling a great sense of accomplishment. Catalina is a bit leery of the entire situation though.  “How can you be sure of this? He’s a vampire! Last I heard they aren’t too happy with us right now!” Catalina says. “He’s an outcast from the clans. He’s been living like an animal for who knows how long. I’ve given him a sense of purpose again. He’ll help. Besides he’s better suited to take care of the tribes in Drozz. He’ll take all the risk and we’ll gain the benefit. I see no downside!” “How do you know he won’t just kill your emissary there and not do anything?” “It’s certainly possible, but he did give me some of his ghouls as an act of good faith.” “A bunch of mangy ghouls can’t make up for one necromancer!” “Considering I left Hessan with him, you could make the argument that they do! Relax! I know what I’m doing.” “I hope so, because I heard that the Grand Alliance is stepping up their military operations.”  Catalina leaves you in a huff. What’s with this girl? One minute she’s expressing interest, the next she’s pissed at you. Oh well. You’re not worried about anything, you’re confident you made the right decision.  A few months pass and you get a letter via bat from The Ghoul King. He tells you that he’s got something special for you. Something that Hessan can’t transport himself. You make your way back to Drozz, traveling invisibly for the most part, since last you heard, the Grand Alliance ousted Trelik from the Brot Kingdom and are currently stationed there, probably planning to attack you next.  When you arrive, the Ghoul King meets you.  “Well don’t say I haven’t held up my part of this alliance. Here are your giants. A whole tribe of them! Took a hell of a long time dragging them down here. You’ll have to forgive the bite marks, but my ghouls do get hungry every now and then.”  You can’t believe your eyes. You expected one or two. Not a whole tribe! You aren’t even going to ask how he did it, you’re just happy he did.  “Alright Mr. Necromancer, I wanna see you raise these big ass things! Your emissary has been going on for months about how powerful you are, so I wanna see this.”  You begin to concentrate…  Slowly one of the dead behemoths rises and stands ready to serve. You concentrate again and one by one each one stands up and fully obedient to you. It requires very little energy on your part surprisingly. You must be growing in power.  “Well now, I guess you can walk the walk! Alright now you go have fun with those big boys. I have some barbarians to terrorize. It seems I’ve inadvertently united most of the tribes against me with this giant killing business.” “You need some help?” “Nah, I got it all under control. I was sick of hiding anyway. Thanks though. Especially for making me feel like a true vampire again rather than a running scavenger.”  You tell Hessan to stay with the Ghoul King as you still need someone here in Drozz. One day you’ll have to construct some sort of portal between here and Aftermath, but that will have to be later. Right now you’ve got undead giants and you’re all prepared to use them right away. You remember The Grand Alliance is in the Brot Kingdom and tthat they’re probably still recovering from battling Trelik recently.  You march with your undead giants to the Brot Kingdom. You have no back up, just you. You’re going to show them all what you’re capable of…  Your arrival isn’t surprising since they could see you coming from quite a few miles away, but the utter fear you inspired was immense and there still wasn’t enough time for the Grand Alliance to get reinforcements.  Your undead giants smash and destroy buildings. They crush knights under foot. The carnage is great. You supplement your attack by raising the recent dead to your cause. Graveyards are your reinforcements.  You see the remnants of Grand Alliance flee. Let them flee. Let them speak of the terror and the death!  The news of what you did travels fast, and Catalina runs to meet you when you arrive back in Aftermath.  “What the hell did you think you were doing risking your life like that? You should’ve come back to Aftermath for more soldiers before taking on the Brot Kingdom AND the Grand Alliance all by yourself!” “Why? Were you worried about me?” you smile. “Well… um…no! But, you should’ve told me!” “I did tell you. I told you I had everything worked out and look…I did.” You say putting your arm around her. She’s not resisting anymore.  “Hmmm, well I guess you did. So now what?” “Now what? You and me in the bedroom, that’s what!”  You and Catalina at last end this little dance and consummate your relationship.  And just think all it took was destroying an entire kingdom with some undead giants!   Four years pass…  It’s been five years since you took control of Aftermath and you’ve made progress. Many changes have certainly have come about.  Your territory now encompasses far more than just Aftermath. You now control several former kingdoms. You call your region the Dead Dominion. The population consists mainly of the dead, with necromancers typically being the only living beings, though there are pockets of living that have pledged their loyalty to you in exchange for mercy. You have granted it. You and Catalina are now truly King and Queen of the dead.  Velzix has benefited from your success, due to the excessive problems you’ve given the Grand Alliance; he’s expanded his own realm relatively unchecked. Minor conflict has come about between your respective domains, and it’s only a matter of time before all out war occurs. Rumors are that he’s attempting to rip open a portal of the largest size to unleash all of the horrors the infernal plane has to offer.  The Grand Alliance is attempting to handle the pair of you, but has only succeeded in fighting to a stalemate. Rumors are the Zalan Empire is attempting to take full control over the Grand Alliance in order to pursue a more extreme course of action.  You have not heard anything from you family. You know your Dad’s mercenary company has been fighting in the outskirts of Velzix’s realm. Your sister has become a respected and successful Grand Alliance captain. She’s managed to hold back the tide of your dead horde from gaining anymore ground for a couple years now. As for your Mom, who knows? You’d prefer not to know what she thinks of you.  The Vampire Clans have unsuccessfully sent assassins after you, but they have all failed. The Ghoul King suggests that an attack should be made on them soon. He mentions he knows where their secret fortress is and now that he has the support he wishes to take his revenge. He has completely conquered Drozz and turned into a true Kingdom (The only one semi-independent from your Dead Dominion) no longer does he hide in a hole.  As for Trelik, you have heard nothing. For all you know he may be dead. He disappeared soon after his defeat at Brot four years ago.  But today is another day and with that new problems come. You have to decide which new direction you’re going to steer your Dominion."
7397,26,"Sometimes it takes a “bad guy” to take out another bad guy, maybe even two…  “Catalina I think it’s time to attack Velzix.” You say walking into her study. “Oh you do huh? Got a plan in mind of how to go about it? Because it’s not going to be easy.” “Well I figured we’d just go in there and chop his head off.” You laugh. “Ha ha. Sometimes you have a really strange sense of humor. You realize that the Grand Alliance has been trying to chop his head off for years and they haven’t been successful.” “Yeah, well they ain’t me. Besides I got an angle. My Dad’s mercenary company is over there right now. I can get help from him.”  Catalina looks at you as if you’ve gone completely insane.  “Your Dad? The one you’ve always complained about? The bastard that you say could barely stand you? The one I think is the reason you got into necromancy in the first place, to prove you could be more powerful than he could ever be?” “Uh…excuse me?” you say after hearing that last bit of psychoanalysis. “What makes you think he’ll help you?” “He might not, I dunno just how pissed he is at me, but I figure if there’s any chance he might, I’ll try it. He probably has good intelligence on the realm. Besides, he’s an opportunist first of all. If Velzix wins. We all lose. BUT if I win, well just maybe I’ll take sentimental mercy on the old man and the family.” “Would you?” Catalina asks. “With my Mom and sis? Sure.” You grin. “I dunno about this family stuff, sometimes I’m glad I was an orphan.” Catalina sighs. “But if you think it’s worth a shot, you should try it. It’s not like we have too much of an advantage over Velzix. I worry that we’ll expend too much power in an attempt to destroy him, leaving us open for a Grand Alliance attack.” “I’m really not worried about the Grand Alliance. They’re suffering from their own internal squabbles from what I’ve heard and if I do this the way I think it might go, we won’t need to waste one corpse on Velzix’s realm. Okay, as usual you’re going to be in charge of things while I’m gone.”  You kiss Catalina goodbye and make your way to Velzix’s realm alone…  Velzix’s realm is appropriately a wretched place. Sure there is death here, but none of its purity or beauty exists. Demons torment the mortal population with much delight. You get a few attempts to torment you and you teach them a fatal lesson. You stay invisible while you can though.   Using a few ghostly scouts and a couple of minor divination spells (Thank the gods Catalina’s been around to help you with other types of magic!) you soon determine the exact location of your Dad.  You don’t know what to expect, you haven’t seen him in years. When you approach the camp, you’re immediately met by guards.  “HALT! Who the hell are you?” “I’m more powerful than you could ever imagine…tell your asshole of a Captain that his son is here.”  The two guards’ eyes widen, they know about you and they run off almost immediately to tell your Dad. You wait patiently and sure enough your Dad comes from out of his tent with his lackeys hiding behind him.  “Boy, you gotta a lot of balls showing up here before me. Didn’t think you had ‘em either. Figured you’d be hiding in some tower somewhere.” “Yeah, well sometimes you have to do things yourself.” “True. So, you here to try to kill me boy? That why you here? Gonna break yer Mom’s heart even more? Y’know she still cries over what you’ve become even after I’ve told her time and time again that you ain’t worth one of her fuckin’ tears?”  You didn’t like hearing that…  “Yeah well Mom’s always been the nice one, must be something like her wasting her love on a mean spirited abusive bastard that probably would’ve killed her AFTER he raped her if not for the powerful magic aura she exuded.”  He didn’t like hearing that…  “Bah! I don’t need to hear this shit! If yer gonna try an’ kill me, you best do it now boy!” your Dad shouts as he begins to draw his sword."
7397,27,"You can’t put up with this asshole anymore. You had to put up with him as a kid and as a teenager and even when you went away to college! Well no more! You’re a lot more powerful and you’re going to finally teach the old man a lesson.  You unleash a death cloud upon your Dad and his company, most of them fall to their knees choking up blood before dying. Your Dad is made of a little stronger stuff and charges at you, but you blast him with a bolt of negative energy. He falls, struggling to breathe.  “(Wheeze) Hope yer happy boy…you killed an old man, with some sissy magic tricks…ha ha…Mr. Big Fancy Nec…” “SHUT UP AND DIE!” you shout and cause his flesh to age at an accelerated rate and rot. You don’t stop until his skull becomes dust.  You sit down beside the dust in exasperation. You allowed him to “get” to you. You didn’t want that to happen. Especially since you wanted his help to get to Velzix. Still you may be able to probe the minds of his dead soldiers and still go through with your plan of killing Velzix yourself.  Or you could decide that doing this alone would be suicide and go back to Aftermath."
7397,28,"You didn’t need your Dad to get where you are, you don’t need him to kill Velzix either. You’ll do it yourself, like you always have. You probe the minds of the dead to get your information.  You scan them all to make sure you don’t miss anything. Excellent, they’ve all been within the inner reaches of Velzix’s realm. You know exactly where he dwells.  You sneak and creep and lurk better than any dark elf assassin while on your way to Velzix’s fortress. When you arrive, you go through the secret way you saw in the minds of one of the soldiers. You can feel the malevolence emanating from all areas of this place.  It doesn’t take long before you get into trouble. Demon and mortal patrols hunt you down. The mortal patrols you welcome since you can easily kill and then raise them. Still, you need to get to Velzix soon, before you’re completely overrun.  Eventually you reach Velzix’s throne room. He’s already prepared for battle.  “Ha ha! At last a real fight! I shall enjoy ripping you apart and feasting on your soul little necromancer!” he chortles and swings a huge whip at you.  You summon up ghostly warriors to assist you, and Velzix responds in kind by opening up several portals where large amounts of demons come pouring out. While you’re powerful, you can’t fight Velzix’s seemingly endless reinforcement of demons. You land some good hits, but ultimately you’re overwhelmed.   Velzix picks up your drained bloody body to mock you one last time.  “Since you took the effort to come visit me personally, perhaps I’ll pay that little queen of yours a visit personally too. Show her what REAL power is!”  Velzix then proceeds to make good on his promise and slowly rips your soul apart before ultimately sending you to oblivion."
7397,29,"You can’t go in and kill Velzix just by yourself. This wasn’t one of your best ideas, you decide you better head back before you attract anymore demon attacks.  Catalina meets you when you get back and tells you that The Ghoul King has been iching to strike against the Vampire Clans and that he’s going to do it, with or without your direct help.  You’re too tired from your recent ordeal to even argue or do anything about it. You tell her that he can do what he’s gotta do. If he wants your help, Hessan and whatever pitiful army he can muster up is his to command. You don’t care.  You retire to your study where you reflect upon what will come next.  Five years pass…  It’s been ten years since you took control of Aftermath and now it looks like that’s all finally coming to an end.  The Ghoul King’s assault upon the Vampire Clans was a failure, though it was damaging enough for them to never again bother you again. You have to move some necromancers into the Drozz region to take command there, which stretches you out a bit, since you didn’t need to worry about it so directly before, having the Ghoul King there and all.  After years of fighting a three way stalemate, at last one side makes progress and unfortunately it’s Velzix. Without your Dad’s constant meddling and sabotaging, Velzix manages to permanently open up a large portal to his home plane. He declares all out war on the entire world determined to turn it into the same hell he once called home.  The Grand Alliance attempts to stop him, but is soon crushed. You hear that your sister died defending the capital of the Zalan Empire during its last days. You can only presume your Mom suffered the same fate, seeing as she lived there as well. You hope that the pair of them have gone some place better  With the last bastion of “good” out of the way, Velzix turns his attention towards you. You won’t go without a fight though. For every bit of land he takes, you make him pay for it in demon blood tenfold.    It’s no use though, the hordes of hell are without end and while the dead are certainly just as numerous, you’re the only necromancer powerful enough to command epic armies of them and you are only one standing against hell itself.  Aftermath is besieged and ultimately falls to demonic armies. Catalina is killed during the attack and you disintegrate her body before escaping through a portal to Drozz as you refuse to let it be desecrated by demon scum.  You wage a guerilla war in Drozz for months, and you can’t help but realize you’ve become much like the Ghoul King; hiding in a hole while demons take over the world. For awhile you actually have some peace as the demons soon outnumber their “enemies” and begin to follow their natural instincts of in-fighting and you’re forgotten.  When the next winter comes you’re caught out in a heavy blizzard while foraging for food. You’re not going to make it back to your hiding place.  Exhausted, you fall in the snow thinking about the hell that the world has become and how you’re partially responsible. Eternal sleep is welcomed.  You embrace the blessed death that you once held mastery over."
7397,30,"“If I was going to kill you, I’d barely need to lift a finger, but what I’m mainly here for is your help.” You say calmly  That’s caught his attention.  “What’s that boy? You want my help? Hanging around those corpses make you completely crazy?” “Not completely, but I know that you and your company has been fighting a guerilla war against Velzix. You’ve been a real pain in his demon ass from what I’ve heard.” “Hah! Got that right! I’ve currently been hired out perpetually by the Zalan Empire. My mission is to generally fuck things up for Velzix, even try to kill him if possible. But I can’t do that.” “Why not?” “Why not? Because if you haven’t noticed I’m a fuckin’ old man that only has a few desperate and insane men following him that’s why! I don’t have a Grand Alliance army behind me like your sister and I can’t just snap my fingers and bring my losses back to fucking life! SOME of us have to rely on pure skill!” “Sounds like you’re making excuses.” “Oh fuck you! Stupid ass kid, I don’t see you doing shit about Velzix, what’s the matter need more corpses to hide behind?” “Actually any corpses I hide behind will only be the ones I summon up during our assassination attempt.” “What are you getting at boy?” “I’m saying you get me close to Velzix, and I’ll kill him. In fact I’m very surprised the Grand Alliance hasn’t sent some hero types to try to kill him yet.” “Oh they have, they just haven’t been heroic enough. My little company has done more damage than any so called heroes. But supposin’ I WAS to help you, what’s in this for me?” “Oh you’ll be paid, have no fear of that. In fact you can even take credit for Velzix death, since I doubt you’d want anyone to know you were working with me. Now I’d imagine that would pay quite well wouldn’t it?” “Yeah, yeah it would…alright boy. We’ll do this, but after Velzix is dead, me and you end this father and son time got me?” “Wouldn’t have it any other way.”   As your Dad proceeds to lead to where Velzix dwells, he explain the layout of it. He says they’ve gone in there before, but have never stayed too long. Just to sabotage stuff and get the fuck out.  You proceed to have more interesting conversation along the way.  “So why the hell hasn’t the Grand Alliance done more about Velzix? Why are they relying on some broken down ex-cuthroat?” you ask. “I told ya, they have sent hero types after Velzix before, but he’s defeated them every time. As for larger military concerns, I’m sure you’re aware that they happen, but it’s a question of balance. They can’t attack Velzix, like they probably would prefer since they know that YOU would take advantage of their weakened state! Not to mention the Grand Alliance finds you to be a bigger threat. The world was almost consumed once already by some megalomaniacal necromancer, they don’t want that to happen again. So little groups like mine fuck things up for Velzix, just enough to keep him occupied and doesn’t gain anymore ground.” “Actually I’m not a megalomaniac. Contrary to popular belief, I don’t have some desire to turn the world into a graveyard.” You say. “Oh well I guess all those kingdoms were just you being neighborly eh? What about that first attack on the Brot Kingdom? Those big ass undead giants? Hordes of undead troops slaughtering men, women and children?” “I did what I had to do to defend myself. War isn’t pretty. People die.” “True…but I still fail to see where yer NOT being a megalomaniac.” “I told you I’m defending my dominion! If the Grand Alliance would stop attacking me, I wouldn’t pursue anymore territory. I’d be happy to live in peace, side by side. Why do you think I want to get rid Velzix? I’m hoping after he’s gone that I can come to some agreement with the Grand Alliance! Because in the end it isn’t going to be good for anyone!” “Fancy words…but I question if that’s what you really want. I haven’t seen you in a long time, but within the short time I’ve talked with you now, even I can see a change in you. You have a lot of desire, somewhere within you, you want to control everything so there’s no possibility of anything ever hurting you. You’re actually good at something and you’re reveling in it. I know what that’s like. While you might have yer Mom’s magic, apparently you DID inherit some of my qualities, and those are qualities that are all kinds of bad…” “I’m nothing like you!” you exclaim. “Ha ha! Oh yer right about that. You’ll never be half the man I am. You can turn the entire world to a giant mass grave, but you ain’t never gonna be me.”  Even now with all your power your Dad still somehow manages to make you feel small. You can’t let yourself get angry though, As much as you might like to just cause the bastard’s black heart to explode in his chest you can’t do that, at least not yet.  You, your Dad and the remains of his company eventually arrive at Velzix’s fortress where you enter in a secret way.  “Dumb ass demons, we’ve been using this entrance for like a year now and they still haven’t caught on!” your Dad remarks.  You make good progress in the fortress and then…  “There they are, just like Velzix said they would be!” a demon guard shouts.  You look at your Dad.  “Haven’t caught on yet huh?” “Quit yer bitchin’ and start doin that death magic thing!”  You proceed to do just that as demon as well as mortal guards attempt to stop you. You welcome the mortal guards as you can raise them to help you in your “heroic quest”.  “Hah, no lying down on the job anymore Cal!” your Dad laughs as you raise the last of his fallen company.  By the time you reach Velzix’s inner sanctum, it’s just you and your Dad. You never thought in a million years you’d be fighting alongside your Dad.  Velzix on the other hand has been expecting you.  “Ah how good of you both to come. You’re the miserable little has been thug that’s been fucking up my realm with your guerilla warfare. And you’re the wannabe Lich Lord that’s been impeding my own plans of conquest.”  “Wow, guess he got it in one.” You say. “Yeah, and I guess this would make him the pathetic ass demon lord that can’t even beat said has been and wannabe.” Your Dad adds. “Enough! The pair of you have sealed your doom today! I have lured you into my trap where today I shall take the father and the son and then…”  You blast Velzix in the face with negative energy, causing him to grab his face and roar in pain.  “Ha ha! Fucking melodramatic idiot!” your Dad laughs charging at Velzix with his sword  You quickly decide on what to do next."
7397,31,"You need to keep Velzix as occupied as possible, before he starts opening up portals to summon in reinforcements because if he gets a chance to do that, you’re fucked.  Using tremendous power you summon up revenants. Souls of the dead who harbor a desire for revenge against their killer and given how many Velzix has killed, you barely need to even to control them. They immediately go for the attack.    “ASH! I’ll turn you ALL to ash!” Velzix claims, unleashing a blast of hellfire disintegrating one of the revenants.  You have a hard time aiming, do to the constant movement of Velzix, but you manage to land in your own magic attacks. Your Dad is doing pretty well, though it’s obvious that he’s tired. He’s running on pure adrenaline right now.  While Velzix might be too occupied to open portals, he’s still got his guards in the fortress. More of them arrive, but you take care of them and raise the mortal ones to attack their former master.  Eventually Velzix manages to grab your Dad and proceeds to smash him into the stone floor several times before throwing him into a wall. The corpses and revenants continue to strike Velzix the entire time. He’s severely wounded himself, and attempts to open a portal while ignoring the pain.  You cast greater blast of negative energy at Velzix hitting him in the eyes and blinding him.  “NO! I cannot be defeated! Not like this!” he bellows in agony while falling to the floor  You take your Dad’s sword which is lying nearby on the floor.  “Nope, you’ll be defeated like this.” You say and with one good chop you sever Velzix’s head from his body.  In a horribly comical display, Velzix’s body flails about wildly for a few minutes until its finally hacked to bits by the revenants. Some more of Velzix’s guard arrive and seeing their leader in pieces, they run off. You tell your revenants to hunt them down and fulfill their need for revenge.  Just you and Dad now. He lies against the wall broken and bloody. He’s very near death. He’s hardly the imposing figure that instilled fear in you when you were little.  “…fuck…I coulda had that demon bastard if I’d been younger.” He growls. “I’m sure you could’ve.” “Shit, I’m all fucked up…guess this is a good day for you. One rival dead and me soon to join him.” “Oddly, I don’t feel too much of anything right now. I probably would’ve taken joy in your death at one time, but not now. I’m not sure what that means though.”  Your Dad just grunts at your answer, before saying one last thing.  “Heh, you chopped that bastard’s head off. No magic tricks. Just visceral physical violence…you impressed me…”  Your Dad dies with those last words. A violent end for a violent man. You wonder why he felt the need to praise you before he died though. Guilt? Regret? Genuine respect? Did he think that by giving you “validation” you might change your ways? Perhaps he felt responsible for your path in some way?  Whatever the reason, you dismiss it all. You chose this path for yourself. Nobody else. Whatever you’ve done, or are going to do it’ll be because you chose to do it.  “(Sigh) Can’t say it was a pleasure Dad, but I guess you were finally alright in the end.” You say and cast a small fireball spell to burn his body.  You make your way back to Aftermath where Catalina meets you. Catalina asks you what happened exactly in Velzix’s realm and you tell her the truth.  “It’s just like I said Cat baby, I went in there and chopped Velzix’s head off. And then my Dad died.” “Oh. Wow. Are you alright?” “Yeah, I guess.” “Okay, well I guess I should tell you, the Ghoul King has been itching to strike against the Vampire Clans and he says that he’s going to do it, with or without your direct help.” “Very well, I’ll go meet him. Might as well get rid of another enemy today.”  Catalina stops you before you leave again.  “Really, are you okay?” “You’re by my side. Of course I’m okay. I want you to start making arrangements to take over Velzix’s territory. When word gets out that he’s dead, the Grand Alliance will be all over it, So let’s get a head start before they do.” You say and kiss her goodbye.  Soon you go meet the Ghoul King in at his “Kingdom” in the Drozz region. Other than the small castle he erected and the ghouls that now roam openly and freely, the area doesn’t look too much different.  When you arrive, he gives a big pointy toothed smile while his hordes of his ghouls wait around.  “Well now, I wasn’t sure if I’d see you. When I spoke to Catalina she mentioned you were having a big show down with Velzix! I trust that went well then, since you’re here.” “Yep, he’s dead.” “Ha ha! Excellent! I guess after this little foray, we’ll only have the Grand Alliance to worry about!” “I don’t think I’ll have to worry about them at all actually.” “You might be right…so are you ready to go? I’ve been lusting for this revenge for years, so if you don’t mind, I want to kill Lord Rostov myself.” “No problem GK, I’ll just be here as support. So where is this Vampire hideout anyway, you never did tell me. How long will it take us to get there?” “Oh I can get us there real quick. I still have the magic key to teleport there. I’ve enhanced its power to transport several of us to invade. As for its location, I’m sure you’re aware that it’s hidden by powerful magic, but its site is in the Deshun Mountains.” The Ghoul King explains while pulling out a small ebony cube “Hm, good location. Remote, treacherous terrain, nobody climbing up there. Let’s do it.”  Before you know it, The Ghoul King presses a button on the cube and you and he materialize in the foyer of a large fortress. No ghouls with you though.  “SHIT! This was supposed to transport all of us!” he shouts, before suddenly quieting his voice. “Yeah, well magic never works out like you want it to half the time. Let’s just get on with it. I’ve already killed a Demon lord today, I’m hardly worried about some decadent bloodsuckers…no offense.” “None taken…but here. Take this.” The Ghoul King hands you a brass ring with several small rubies embedded in it. “Wear it. It’s imbued with magic that will protect you from the gaze of Lord Rostov.” “What? I’m a fucking necromancer; I think I’m a little more strong willed than the average mortal. The stares of some vampire aren’t going to make me go all to mush.” “Maybe, but I still say you should wear it. Lord Rostov is very old and he is more powerful than the average vampire and can be tremendously influential. While you may also be powerful you are still mortal and all the weakness that entails…no offense.” “None taken.”"
7397,32,"You figure it’s better to be safe than sorry so you slip the ring on your finger. Suddenly you feel an incredible paralysis overcome you. You fall to the floor in a weakened state. You can only groan as you see The Ghoul King hover over you.  “I lost my status once for following one insane necromancer with dreams of murdering the world. Now I have gained it back by stopping another one. I did want revenge at one time…but as I said Lord Rostov is a very influential vampire. My lost status was more appealing than revenge or destroying the world. I regret nothing, but I do thank you. For without you, none of this would’ve been possible and I still would’ve been living like an animal in a hole. Thanks to you no more shall I have to be known as the Ghoul King.”  The Ghoul King then whispers one last thing to you.  “And my thanks will extend to giving you a quick death before Lord Rostov arrives.”  The Ghoul King then with his powerful claws smashes your skull in while you lie helplessly on the floor."
7397,33,"“Nah, I don’t need this ring, but thanks anyway GK. Come on let’s…” “I feel you really should wear it. I don’t want you suddenly turn against me during the fight!” “Won’t happen, trust me. Let’s go…”  The Ghoul King is getting noticeably agitated.  “Look! He’ll be coming soon just put the fucking ring on, before he gets here!”  Now you’re getting agitated.  “GK, you better just calm the fuck down. I don’t like being told what to do, unless it’s by Catalina in the bedroom. So…” “Damn you! We’ll do this the old fashioned way then!” he shouts and attacks!  With one powerful blow he knocks you to the floor. You’re still shaking off the cobwebs by the time he’s ready to land a killing strike. He’s stopped by Lord Rostov however.  “That will do Ghoul King. His mortal life is not for yours to take.” Rostov says calmly while entering the foyer with a small group of female vampires. “I told you to stop calling me that! I have delivered my end of the bargain! You promised me that my status would be restored!” “Yes, but you attempted to kill him, when I specifically told you I wanted him alive. You were not completely dedicated to your end of the deal. So while you may continue to stay in the glory of my presence, I think you’ll still remain the Ghoul King.”  The Ghoul King looks like he’s about to argue, but instead he submits.  “Yes, Lord Rostov.” “Ha ha ha ha. You sad sack of shit. Selling me out to be Lord Rostov’s bitch, some deal you made.” You say while getting back up.  Lord Rostov now turns his attention towards you. He looks exactly like what you always heard vampires are supposed to look like. Regal, refined, confident and arrogant as all hell.  “Do not judge the Ghoul King too harshly; his actions were based on survival. True he did long for revenge at one time, but when I came to him with this…arrangement, he jumped at the chance because in the end the Ghoul King has always chosen his own survival over anything else.” “Then he’s failed miserably in that endeavor because he won’t be surviving this.” “I fail to see how idle threats are going to help you right now. In fact this situation would be unnecessary if you hadn’t pursued this path. You only have yourself to blame. Causing chaos and destroying the natural order of things. Ending all life on this world is simply unacceptable.” “…(Sigh) Why is everyone assuming that? I’m PROTECTING myself! Look, I know you still have the puppet master strings going on in the mortal realm. Shit, you’re probably responsible for the Grand Alliance. I’d even be willing to live in peace with the civilized world if they’d stop attacking me!” “I once heard the same thing from another of you ilk long ago. We all did. It’s the reason why we’re in this state we are today. You’re growing more powerful with each death you bring. Whether you know it or not, you’re already addicted to the power. You’re addicted to death. Do you REALLY think you can stop yourself at this point? You won’t. You can’t deny your nature no more than we can deny ours. The Great Lich Lord didn’t stop, and neither will you. The status quo must be kept and for that to happen, you have to die.”   With those words, Lord Rostov uses his supernatural speed before you can react and prompty breaks your neck.  Your heart stops beating. Your lungs stop drawing breath. You fall to the floor dead.  “Best to take care of these things quickly. Remember the lessons of poor Duke Tolov who…”  While Lord Rostov is pontificating about his predecessor, your body undergoes a change. You body is regenerating. The bones in your neck have re-knitted. You open your eyes; your heart is still not beating. You draw no breath, yet you’re still alive. You feel more knowledgeable in the ways of magic and death in particular.  You are the Great Lich Lord reborn…and you are pissed.  You immediately get up and launch a fireball into Lord Rostov’s back. He howls in pain before you cause his heart to explode in his chest, followed by his brain. He falls uselessly on to the ground. His nights of existence are over.  The other vampires in the immediate area sound an alarm, but you’re not worried. A few manage to attack you and land some deep blows, but you feel nothing but numbness. Then you strike back.  You begin to dominate all of their minds. Your powers have grown to an extent that you’re able to directly control even intelligent undead like these. You don’t even want to dirty your hands with dealing with these miserable blood leeches. You cause them all to gruesomely attack one another, until you’re ultimately the last one standing in a fortress filled with dismembered vampires, well one still lives. He still struggles against your mind control, but he knows the end will soon come. He even welcomes it at this point.  “Shouldn’t have done it GK. You had everything. Now only oblivion awaits you.” “I don’t care anymore. This world is going to end soon; I’d rather die before I see that happen. How will it feel when the world is finally under your utter command? What will you do when there is nothing left? Will you be able to be satisfied on just continued existence?” “I guess I’ll find out, because you won’t.”  You cause the Ghoul King to rip his own heart out and bite into it before setting him and the rest of them on fire.  With all the bloodsuckers dead you leave the burning fortress and transport yourself back to Aftermath. When you return Aftermath, Catalina sees your wounds and unnecessarily worries about you.  “Baby, you’re wounded!” “Catalina, I’m fuckin’ dead.” You say sharply and enter your study.  You retire to your study where you put your vampire ordeal out of your mind and reflect upon what will come next while you write a letter to your Mom and Sister about Dad. You figure they should know the truth even if nobody else will.  Even in this new state of existence, you’re so tired…"
7397,34,"Chapter 4: Even Death May Die  Five years pass…  It’s been ten years since you took control of Aftermath and many changes have come about.  Without Velzix’s brutal leadership, his realm soon broke apart. Demon leaders fought amongst themselves and became easier to deal with for the Grand Alliance. Little by little territory was liberated. However you were not idle and you also took pieces of Velzix’s former territory.  Due to all the problems caused by Velzix a new order was enacted by the Grand Alliance. No more chances are being taken and the civilized world has a zero tolerance policy on demons. Demons are to be killed on sight anywhere they are found. Even the so called “nice ones”. Any government found tolerating their presence will be found guilty of demonology and invaded.  This lead to a few misguided liberal types claiming that it was infringing on certain rights, but considering the increasingly draconian Zalan Empire had pretty much taken complete control over the Grand Alliance at this point, they had final say in the matter and executed all such protestors. The Grand Alliance is now merely a name much like Vampire Clans. In reality, it’s the “Zalan Empire and its little friends that better do what it says Alliance”.  Speaking of the Vampire Clans, since your total destruction of their last remaining enclave, their influence has completely left this world. You’ve noticed a reduced effectiveness in Grand Alliance strategy because of this despite that they’ve become more united in recent years. Except for the near mindless bestial ones that roam the countryside they’re effectively extinct. Still, you feel no need to show them mercy and bring them under your control. When one is found, you have it destroyed. The treachery of the Ghoul King has brought this genocide upon their “race.”  Your letter to your family was never replied to, but you are aware it was received. You don’t know exactly how the truth was spun, or who exactly was involved. But you do know your Dad has a statue erected of him in the Zalan capital stating how he nobly gave his life fighting Velzix. Funny how mad men can be turned into heroes so easily.  Your sister is a general of a Grand Alliance army now, which of course continues to attack you despite some of your attempts at coming to some sort of peace agreement.  The fools won’t even listen to reason. There’s no way the Grand Alliance can win this war. You’ve only been growing in power and show no signs of stopping. Even with their stabilized internal struggles under the Zalan Empire’s iron fist they still won’t be able to defeat you. The world has gone mad and you’re the only one making sense anymore. They call you a villain and evil, but from what you’ve seen, you’re no different than any of the other leaders in power. You’re just better at it.  Maybe you should turn the world into a giant graveyard.  Everyone thinks of you as a monster anyway, you see no reason to disappoint…  “Catalina, I think it’s time we finish this war once and for all.” You say walking into her study. “Oh you do, do you? Well, I figured that it was coming eventually. So is there any specific way we’re going about this?” “Yeah, we just make a massive push and don’t stop until every living thing is dead.” “Wow. Everything?” “Everything. I gave the world of the living the chance for peace and they don’t seem to want it. Well I’m tired of fighting, so if the only way to get some peace is to kill everything so be it!” “Well, I mean what happens if some people surrender? I mean you’ll still allow them to live like you usually do right?” “What? What’s with this line of questioning Catalina? You’ve never been one to wince at grand scale carnage.” “…I know, but I…” “Alright, out with it.” “Well I mean after we destroy the Grand Alliance, what then? There will be nothing else to do. I mean do we just reign over a land of the dead until the end of time?” “Sounds about right.” “I dunno, is that our only option?” “For fuck’s sake Cat, what the hell did you become a necromancer for then?” “Because much like you I probably didn’t feel like I had much in common with people and I could feel a pull towards the dark art of necromancy.” “Well what’s the problem?” “…there isn’t a problem…it’s just I feel like the end is coming soon and question what I’ve accomplished in my life. I mean other than genocide what have I done?” “You’re Queen of the Dead! What more could you want?” “Yeah, queen. Big whoop. I’m basically a glorified concubine for a…” “Damn it Catalina I’ve NEVER thought of you as that! You know I cherish you and all of you have to offer. I never could’ve gotten this far without you.” you say holding on to her and looking into her eyes.  “…I know…it’s just in some ways I see you starting to change and I don’t mean your general loathing of the living either. I mean you’ve always been powerful, more powerful than me, but it’s different. It’s like you’re becoming something else. I sometimes think your path is going to differ from mine to a degree that we will no longer be able to be together.”  For a moment you forget about your problems and address Catalina.  “Catalina my beautiful queen…no matter what happens I shall never leave you.” you say and kiss her. “And I shall never leave you…Okay, where are we going to attack?”  While you’ve temporarily reassured Catalina’s feelings, you do wonder if she isn’t right. Will there come a day when you and her will have so many differences that you won’t be able to be together anymore?  You wonder if you’ve been taking some things for granted. You have everything you could ever need or want. Maybe you don’t need to go on the attack. The Grand Alliance surely does not have the strength to defeat you; you doubt it would even attempt to expend all its resources in trying.  Sure you might have to continue to fight them, but when you think about it, would it be less tedious than an existence without any conflict?"
7397,35,"You can better appreciate what you have when all those that would do you harm are gone.  You order an attack of the largest size. While you’re attacking from several directions, you decide to focus specifically on the Zalan Empire given that they’re glue holding the Grand Alliance together. Get rid of them and you’ve effective put an end to the war.  Corpses, skeletons, ghosts, wraiths, and all other manner of undead are raised to your grand plan. Town after town is taken. The Grand Alliance nor the Zalan Military can do anything to stop you. They use magic, they use new technological wonders, but none of it works. It is only when your dead legions approach the gates of the Zalan capital that you call a stop to the carnage.  You arrive personally to oversee your mission and to meet with your family one last time, because even after all this, you don’t want to kill them. Somewhere you hope that they’ll see reason and come with you. Things won’t be so bad.  You storm the gates as cannons destroy multitudes of your troops only to be replaced with more. You see your sister on top of the battlements ordering her soldiers to fire upon you. During this attack you feel several bullets enter your body breaking through your magical defenses.  You fall. You then rise again.  “You can’t kill me, I’m the fuckin’ Great Lich Lord!” you laugh.  Not stopping, you enter the gates of the city realizing that this was inevitable. Things could’ve only been this way. Your undead slay all those that oppose you, but you mentally make sure none of your undead has murderous intentions towards any of your family. You head towards your parent’s old house, taking little notice of the death around you.  When you arrive you find the house empty. In fact it looks like it’s been empty for months. So many memories here…a different time… even a different life now…  “She left when the attacks first came. She didn’t say where either. She just told me she was leaving. I even had her followed for awhile, but she was quite adept at eluding my scouts, not to mention I had other concerns to take care of.” Your sister says entering behind you.  “I don’t know why, I would’ve made sure no harm came to her. That’s why I came here.” “You already harmed her by becoming what you are! I mean…you’re not even alive anymore! I saw you die and come back to life on the battlefield!” “Oh that. The first time was a surprise to me too. Kind of a numb feeling really.” “How can you be so at peace with what you’ve become?” “Because it was obviously in my nature all along. Death is my calling, I’ve only grown closer to it by dying. Can’t change who I am.” “Dad did.” “No he didn’t. Not really. He just directed his nature into a slightly more positive way and it was only due to magic that caused it in the first place. Funny how magic did the same with me, but just in reverse. However, as I’ve said, this does not mean I’m not without total feelings. I’d rather not have to kill you sis, but if you stand against me, I will.” “I have to stand against you.” “Why? For some noble cause of a corrupt mortal empire that’s just as oppressive? Sis you always were a bit too duty bound.” “No, because while you still exist, life ALL life is in danger. You’re evil, what you’ve been doing is evil, what you’ve become is unnatural. You can delude yourself all you want, but I’m not fooled and if I joined you or whatever it is you want, then I’d be just as guilty of contributing to your evil. You’re not even my brother anymore, I have no brother!”  You shake your head in regret at your sister’s insistence on being stubborn, but then again you expected no less.  “I’ll give you one last chance sis. Will you join me?”  Your sister raises her magical glowing sword.  “So be it.”"
7397,36,"You might have become the Great Lich Lord, but if it means killing those you care about, you don’t want it. There’s still time to stop this.  As your sister approaches you make no attempt to defend yourself. She doesn’t hesitate, because she sees in your now dead eyes that you’re giving her this one chance to kill you.  You feel the sword rip through your body, you don’t feel pain, but you definitely feel a loss of power. She then pulls the sword out of your body.  “Better do it now sis. I don’t think I can hold back my nature forever.”  With those words, your sister cleaves your head from your shoulders.  Once again the world has been saved from the brink of death.  In time things get better, though never back to the way they truly were. Catalina committed suicide soon after she found out about your death, but other necromancers quickly attempted to fill the power vacuum. They of course were never able to approach your power, but a few established a permanent dominion of death in the Drozz region. The area to this day is avoided.  Your sister became celebrated as a Hero and eventually took the Zalan crown leading the Empire in a nobler direction. Your Mom came back from where ever it is she disappeared to and together with your sister, mourned your death in private.  For in reality it was you who stopped death from taking over the world, proving that even death can show mercy."
7397,37,"“I’m sorry.” You say calmly and blast your sister with powerful beam of negative energy causing the color to drain from her face and turn her hair completely white. She’s still continues towards you, but another blast causes her to fall. She looks up at you with tears in her eyes and to your surprise she attempts to reach out to you. You crouch down and take her hand which she grips on to tightly.  “…don’t…turn me into…one of those things…please…don’t” she wheezes. “Never. You shall die as you lived. With honor. Your body will be burned.”  This statement seems to reassure her and she closes her eyes and lets go of life.  You really wished you hadn’t had to do that.  “Be at peace at last dear sister. May whatever afterlife you go to be better than this one.”  You cast a small fire ball at your sister’s body and leave the house to burn, feeling yet another piece of your mortalhood die. One of your necromancers sees and comes up to you.  “Lord, we’ve pretty much taken the city. The Emperor and Empress of Zalan were killed in their own throne room. We’ve won.” “Of course.” You say dismissively. “So what do you want done with the city?” “Burn it all to the ground.” “Burn it? Don’t you…” “I SAID BURN IT.” You say not wishing to repeat yourself. “Um Right! Okay you heard the Great Lich Lord! Burn it all to the ground!”  Ten years pass…   Twenty years since you embarked on your path of necromancy. The end of all life looms ever closer.  After the destruction of the Zalan Empire, the remnants of the Grand Alliance fell apart. One by one the remaining kingdoms and other governments fell before your armies. It was almost pathetically easy. The civilized world as it was known is no more. Only the dead exist.  You even had those subjects that once pledged their allegiance to you while still alive killed. You can barely tolerate your own necromancers. Catalina is the only one you still care about anymore. She’s still supportive, but nervous around you. You wish she wasn’t though.  Some races such as elves, sprites and other fairy type folk retreated to their woods and forests, relying on illusions, tricks and other ways to conceal themselves. Other races like dwarves, gnomes and subterranean types dug deeper into the earth hoping that you will forget about them. Yet others like humans, orcs and the like still insist on fighting you from their makeshift camps, using hit and run tactics when they can.  It doesn’t matter what any of them do however, you won’t rest until all life has been extinguished, if it takes you centuries, so be it. You’ll hunt them all, you’ll find them all, you’ll kill them all.  Lately, though there have been odd occurrences. You have sensed disturbances in the very landscape from time to time. In your new undead state you of course never sleep anymore, but you’ve been having visions. Flashbacks. And they seem all too real sometimes.  After months of research you’ve tracked down one of these disturbances to the old Vampire Clan fortress. You make haste to find out if any of those accursed bloodsuckers still live. You don’t see how though as you were thorough in their destruction.  This time you don’t even bother telling Catalina what you think you should do next, you know exactly what you’re going to do. You just walk in her study and tell her you’re leaving for a little while and to keep an eye on things as usual. You teleport yourself to the location of their now desiccated fortress. Partially burned and falling into disrepair from your actions fifteen years ago.  You throw open the massive doors with ease.  “Little blood leeches, if any of you still remain, your best idea would’ve been to hide and stay that way.” Your voice echoes throughout the halls. “No, Great Lich Lord they are all dead. You made sure of that. You always do. It’s just you and me.” you hear a voice shout back. The voice sounds somewhat familiar, but you immediately home in on it since whoever felt the need to talk shit is obviously the one behind all this.  After walking a bit, you enter the throne room where you still see a few traces of dust from the vampires you slaughtered long ago. You hear a maniacal laugh and a man materialize a few feet in front of you. This man looks much different now; his clothing is ragged and filthy. He has a manic grin and giggles a bit while constantly looking around, but you still recognize him and you have to say you’re genuinely surprised to see him. He’s very much alive too.  “Trelik…thought you were long dust by now.” “Nearly was, quite a few times, but after my shameful defeat in the Brot Kingdom I decided to lay low. For when that day came, I knew then I would never be able to defeat you or anyone else. So I waited and watched you gain power. Watched you destroy your enemies. Watched you have everything that I wanted since the days of the Dark Order. Remember those days? Seems like so long ago no?” “Another life time.” “Indeed…I’ve learned that time can be a very bizarre thing…who knows what might’ve happened had events occurred slightly differently due to a split second?” “Is there any point to your insane ramblings Trelik?” “Not really…but perhaps! We shall see…or rather we have seen…all has been seen…”  You don’t like where this is going…  “While I might not be able to kill you, I can do something else! Here’s another blast from the past!”  Suddenly Trelik disappears and you feel yourself going in slow motion…  Oh fuck.  “Ha ha ha ha! Ol’ Quayle’s books sure come in handy, but man do they make you see some crazy shit! I think I’ve gone completely bat shit insane at this point, but who cares? We’re all dead men! Fuck killing the world! Let’s kill reality!”  Trelik isn’t kidding either; the very fabric is warping to a degree you didn’t even see when you were dealing with Quayle.  You suddenly find yourself in the middle of a battle. You notice you’re living again. It’s been so long you almost forgot what’s like to breathe. You take a brief look around and you’re in Aftermath…or Nuro rather.  A demonologist looking very worn from battle sees you and you have to stop yourself from attacking  “Hey hold on! I’m on your side! Shit, this didn’t turn out as planned, did it?” “Oh I dunno, I think it turned out EXACTLY as planned.” You say getting the very real sense that you’ve done this before. The demonologist ignores your strange talk and continues.  “Mr. Demar is still battling the rest of the staff in the college and I’m really worried about what the hell’s going on with Quayle’s spell, I don’t know if you’ve experienced it yet, but I’ve been seeing buildings phase in and out of existence. I knew fucking around with time would be trouble!” “Yeah, it is. I guess I better go handle this. I hope I remember what I did last time.” You say and make your way to see Quayle… again.  When you get to the east campus, you see Catalinia right on time. Looking at her at this age again makes you remember when you desired her mainly for her body rather than all of her other exquisite attributes.  “Nice to see you again. Quayle’s in the gray building right?” You say. “Um, yeah. I think he’s in there, but…” “Yeah I know it’s dangerous, but someone’s gotta go in, so I’ll do it. I’ve risked too much already to fail. I suggest you go help Mr. Demar.” you exclaim. “Wow, this whole thing has really made you really authoritative. You’ve come a long way since Enchantment class.” “Yeah I’ve heard that somewhere else before.”  This time you dispense with your attempts to kiss Catalina. There will be plenty of time for that in the future.  “Now let’s see, if I remember this…” you say as you make your way to the gray building avoiding the time disturbances.  When you enter the building you see Quayle again. Same position. Same glow of white light.  “You are the future…there is no future…there are many futures…it’s all so fascinating…” he says once again in an echoed voice. “Hey Quayle, you know we’ve done this before right?” “…yes…yes we have…we will continue to do so…such is time…it is inevitable…”  Any second now the weird tentacle creatures are going to start popping out and you don’t feel like dealing with them again. You didn’t want to do it the first time.  In fact this whole event is making your mind feel weird again, you feel like you’re losing something just by being here."
7397,38,"You remember what you did last time and it was successful, so you confidently try again.  You run towards Quayle narrowly dodging a tentacle creature along the way…  Quayle once again splatters into a gooey insect mess.  Something changes though. You’re no longer aware of the fact that you’re in the past. In fact your memories only lead up to this particular moment and right now all you’re concerned about it is getting these centipedes off of you.  And so it goes, you live out the same exact “life” as you did before. Taking over Aftermath, destroy Brot with undead giants, killing Velzix…all of it.  Eventually you meet Trelik again, and the same things happens. And again. And again. And again. You don’t realize it at all.  Trelik has trapped you in a time loop that you have no knowledge of anymore. And that is where you will stay.  Until the end of time…"
7397,39,"This isn’t “your time” and something is very different. You can sense it. Something is here that wasn’t before.  You quickly scan the room again and from the far left side of the room you hear a little giggle.  One of tentacle creatures appear once again and you fight back the nausea long enough to cast a blast of negative energy towards the sounds of the laughter.  Trelik materializes from your lucky direct hit and howls in pain before collapsing on the floor. His high pitched screech seems to irk the creature and it grabs him with one of the tentacles.    “NO! NO! HAHAHAHA! I WAS GOING TO CONTROL TIME!” Trelik laughs before they turn into screams when the creature proceeds to devour him.  Trelik might’ve been dealt with, but you still have to preserve the time line! You immediately rush to tackle Quayle and narrowly dodge another tentacle beast that appears near you.  You are just about to reach Quayle…  “…once again…the future…the past…unite…” you hear Quayle just as you’re about to collide with him.  Except instead of colliding with him you collide into the stone floor of the vampire fortress! Or at least you thought it was…  You stand up and find yourself in the middle of a castle, but it’s different. You see dead elves and humans lying on the floor. Looks like they were fighting each other. You attempt to raise them, but nothing happens. Your powers aren’t working at all and in this living flesh cage you’ve been once again cursed with, you feel pretty vulnerable.  You hear human soldiers laughing and running and you hide.  “Har har! This was a good idea. Elves can’t fight worth shit! Where’s the captain anyway?” “Oh you know him; he’s probably finding something of more value to keep to himself.”  After they pass by you proceed to make your way through the ruins of this castle which is obviously under siege. You think you’re nearing the exit when all of a sudden you hear the sounds of battle and a very familiar voice…  “You better save your own ass elf, I mean to have whatever is behind that door and the likes of you aren’t going to stop me!” your Dad remarks. “Never! I have sworn to protect the treasure behind here with my life!” the Elven guard exclaims.  You see your Dad and this elven guard clash swords. You watch from the shadows and it’s obvious that this elf is slightly more skilled than your Dad. You might not have your powers, but you realize what has happened. You’ve been transported to the past again. This is the elven castle that your Dad laid siege to. He’s supposed to meet your Mom here. She’s probably the “treasure” that the elven guard is protecting.  Another familiar voice calls out to you in your mind with a sorrow filled tone.  “You wish to end all life because you loathe it so? Or is it that you loathe your own life? I have seen you set out on this path and while regrettable I see that it was inevitable. Perhaps I am to blame. I give you a chance to make things right and allow life to bloom once again instead of an existence of ultimate isolation and loneliness.”  That voice sounded very much like your Mom. But you haven’t discovered any trace of her despite your searches. Then again that might make sense if she’s gone into this time slipping business.  “Mom…do you defy me as well? Have you and Trelik formed some unholy alliance?” you whisper under your breath to her while attempting to contain your anger and wounded feelings. Feelings you haven’t really had in a long time. “No, my son. Trelik’s mad plan was his own. I have merely taken advantage of his poor judgment in attempting to alter time. Yes son, you are not the only one in the family who has the knowledge of forbidden magic and a master of it. I give you a choice…life or death. Think carefully about making your decision. Think about your possible future. Think about what you’ve become. Think about what you’ve done. Your existence has caused the end of the world’s own. Is that really what you want?”  This question has been posed to you many times before in the past. Every time you’ve dismissed it because it’s been so far off before. But as the end grows ever closer, you’ll have to come to very real possibility that immortality on a dead world may very well grow dreary. This latest time trip has been the most excitement you’ve had in years…  You look over at your Dad, who is losing his battle with the elven guard.  Maybe it would be better had you never been born…"
7397,40,"Destiny can be changed, but you’re not changing yours. You were meant to do this. You’ll see this out to the very end.  Since you don’t have any of your powers, you pick up a hefty nearby vase and hurl it at the elven guard from the shadows. Your aim is pitiful as the vase completely misses him and instead flies over his head and hits the wall.  However, the elven guard glances briefly in the direction to which the vase was thrown long enough for your Dad to take the advantage. He skewers the elf and smashes him in the face with his armored gauntlet.  “Ha ha! Stupid fucking elf! Shoulda been paying attention to the fight!” he laughs and gives the guard one last kick to the head before opening up the treasure door…  You slink away. Your birth has now been assured and you suddenly are transported back to your proper time period and back in the ex-vampire fortress. Once again you are undead, however, you find that you have a letter in your hand which is addressed to you  Son,  If you’re reading this then you have chosen death, as was predicted. I do not blame you for embracing your destiny. The pull of dark magic has always been strong in the bloodline. Elves typically can control such urges, however as you know you are not full elven, but still I did not think this possible of you though. You were so unskilled in the ways of magic that the chances of you becoming a competent necromancer seemed so unlikely, let alone an emissary of death. I will not stand in you way for I cannot bring myself to destroy you, even though I could. This is why I gave you the choice to destroy yourself. Do not look for me as I have long left this world and time, a simpler time, long even before the rise of the first Great Lich Lord. Indeed, I am already long dead by the time you have read this. My final gift to you my son, one less death you need concern yourself about. I only hope that you can find peace in your path for eventually you will be alone.  Love Mom.  You crumple the letter.  “Thanks Mom.” You say and return to Aftermath as you have shed one more link to your mortal life.  Thirty years pass…  Fifty years have passed. Peace reigns. There is no more conflict. All serious resistance has been eliminated. There will be no heroes to save the world. Death has won.  Your powers have grown to the extent that your mere presence is slowly killing the world. You tested out this theory when you spent some time in one of the last elven defended forests. The trees began to rot and wither within a day. Reports talk of even the creatures in the oceans dying and you haven’t even been anywhere near there. Anything still alive will die soon; it’s only a matter of time. Your poison is enveloping the skies, the waters and the ground far beneath the earth.  You truly have become death personified.  Your necromancers have all died and you didn’t allow them to try to become liches either. A small coup was attempted, but it was easily put down. You’re controlling it all.  The one last link to your mortal “life” remains. Catalina. She lies on her bed dying. It is only due to her own powers that she’s been able to survive your presence this long, but she can’t do it any longer. You’re too powerful.  You sit by her bed to talk to her one last time. You stroke her hair and hold her hand relishing the warmth that it still gives off even in this near death state.  “…I’m sorry I can’t stay with you.” she says. “You could. You have the power to become a lich.” “…no…I don’t want that. It’s not my desire or path. I once said I thought the differences between us would be too great for us to stay together.” “I remember. And you were right. You usually are.” “We had a good run though didn’t we?” “Yes, yes we did.” You agree. “Are you going to be alright? I mean what are you going to do?” she asks. “Me? I’ll be fine. I’ll stick around and oversee things I guess. Watch the world die. I have to carry this out to end.” “I know you do…maybe we’ll meet again? On the other side?” she smiles weakly.  “I’m sure if it’s possible. We will.” “I love you…”  You then kiss her one last time as life finally fades from her body.  “My love from this world is now gone, what little was left has followed you to the other side my beloved queen. May it be with you always.”  Death now walks alone.  After burning her body, you retire to your study, waiting and wondering when the end will finally come..."
7397,41,"Life must continue. At last you have seen reason.  You watch a bit more and the elven guard is hard pressed, but it becomes apparent that he’s dedicated to his duty. He strikes your Dad with a couple of sword blows to his chest. He falls cursing and swearing, before the elven guard finishes him off with a thrust to his neck.  “Heh, that’s what should’ve happened in the first place.” You say and quietly slink off.  You walk into an empty room and wonder what will happen next. You’ve just destroyed your existence. Though you’re still here, so you’re not sure what that means. Are you going to disappear soon, or will you just continue your existence until you reach your “proper time?”  You hear your Mom’s voice again, one last time.  “You have chosen life as was predicted. Your time as you know it is no more…time…time defeats all. Time even defeats death…however time is not without mercy and your existence in history is not gone, just altered. …the future…the past…does it matter? You will die …all has been written…farewell son. We shall not meet again. You shall have no knowledge of any of this or what has occurred before. But your actions have preserved life, even if you are an emissary of death…”  You suddenly find yourself transported on some desolate hilltop. You have no idea where you’re at, let alone how you got there. In fact you don’t have too much memory of anything. All you’re sure of is that you have a great knowledge of magic and that you’re not truly alive.  Suddenly a ragged bunch of individuals approach, you prepare to defend yourself, but these half crazed tribals are in awe of you.  “It’s him! He is the one we called upon! Our prayers have been answered! We have sacrificed our remaining livestock to appease you! Please our village has suffered a great loss. We have lost many of our people to a plague. We beg you to reunite us with those loved ones we have lost.”  And so began the first steps of the Great Lich Lord’s quest for the extinction of life…"
7397,42,"You realize something. You’ve won. You don’t need to commit worldwide slaughter. In fact at this point you’d rather just give it all up in exchange for peace and quiet with Catalina. And you know the place you could do such a thing.  “Catalina, let’s forget all this.” “What?” “I’m saying fuck this shit. I’m getting bored with it, there’s not really a challenge anymore, so what’s the point? Let’s just leave.” “Well where are we going to do that?” “Let’s go to that hidden Vampire Clan fortress. Nobody else is using it and all it needs is a little fixing up. I can easily set up the magic to hide it again.” “Easily eh? Boy you have come a long way. I remember when you cast that spell in enchantment class and caused all those frogs to attack the professor.” “Boy you’re never going to let me forget that are you? I still think those were a species of killer frogs and they would’ve attacked anyway.” “What? Those were pygmy Eraw frogs! They’re one of the most benign creatures on the planet! YOU turned them into killers!” Catalina laughs. “Yeah, well he deserved it anyway. He was going to fail me.” “I’m surprised he didn’t after that, though he probably was a little afraid of you. Guess you always had it in you even back then.” “Yeah…well you ready to go?” “Wait we’re just leaving? Shouldn’t we make arrangements or something first?” “Like I said fuck it, let all these necromancers fight over it. If one of them thinks they can try to take my place then let ‘em. I predict it’ll all fall apart within a year though. They can’t be me.” “No they can’t. Let’s go.”  You and Catalina then press the key to the old vampire fortress. Fortunately it doesn’t need too much fixing up and you have it restored in no time. It is from here where you and Catalina stay to watch the world events unfold in fascination.  Just as you predicted your dominion of the dead collapsed due to infighting. To your surprise Trelik popped up again and amusingly he even claimed he’d destroyed you and Catalina. Even more amusingly he was one of the first usurpers to die during the civil war.  The Grand Alliance took advantage of the situation and eventually broke the stranglehold that the dead once held over the living. Your sister stormed the gates of Aftermath itself and reclaimed it. She became a hero of epic proportions. You’re glad. You’re glad you made this decision. You didn’t want to have to kill her or your Mom.  The world didn’t immediately go back to normal though. Your actions have had repercussions and there yet still remains areas of the world where necromancers rule, possibly the undead will always have a strong influence in some areas, but the threat of the end of all life is no longer a possibility. Your own powers seem to have grown a bit weaker, make no mistake, you are still very powerful. Possibly still the most powerful being on the planet, but with the rise of life once again, you do feel a change, and you don’t mind it.  The years pass and you and Catalina are content to just watch the world go by and enjoy each others’ company undisturbed. One day though, Catalina’s life force is giving out and she does not wish to continue her existence into undeath like you and you certainly understand.  You and her say goodbye and then you promise you will soon join her. After burning her body you sit on your throne, you write one last thing in your journal about why you did what you did in case anyone should find this.  Then you concentrate and will yourself to die. It takes some effort, but eventually you feel a release and your powers are fading completely.  “I’m coming home Catalina.”  At last, death has died."
7397,43,"Once again you aim for Velzix, ready to unleash a great blast of negative energy at him. Unfortunately as you do so, he picks your Dad up and both of them get caught in it.  Your Dad is killed instantly, but Velzix is of course made of stronger stuff. He recovers from the attack and opens up several portals where demons come pouring out. You summon up ghostly warriors to assist you, and while you’re powerful, you can’t fight Velzix’s seemingly endless reinforcement of demons. You land some good hits, but ultimately you’re overwhelmed.  Velzix picks up your drained bloody body to mock you one last time.  “Look on the bright side; at least you got to kill your Dad!”  Velzix then proceeds to slowly rip your soul apart before ultimately sending you to oblivion."
7397,44,"The Grand Alliance is more unified and suffers less in-fighting (at least not on a violent scale) than Velzix’s crew. You figure you should take them out first.  “Catalina I think it’s time to attack Grand Alliance and wipe them out once and for all.” You say walking into her study. “Oh you do huh? Got a plan in mind of how to go about it? Because it’s not going to be easy.” “I figure the strongest link is the Zalan Empire. If we take them out, the rest of the Alliance will quickly fall apart and we can concentrate on Velzix.” “Hmm, you make it sound so easy. I hope you know what you’re doing.” “Relax, I always know what I’m doing. Set it up and organize the troops, I’ll be overseeing this one personally.”  Months pass and you make good progress. You begin taking town after town like an unstoppable juggernaut. However, when you reach you reach the Zalan Empire’s borders you begin to face heavier resistance. The Grand Alliance combined with the full brunt of Zalan’s own military is proving to be more troublesome than you anticipated. They’ve developed a lot more technological advances since the last time you were here. The cannons are really taking a toll on your corporeal troops.  You slog on through, but eventually reach a stand still when you finally reach the gates of the Zalan capital. Your sister is overseeing the defense of Zalan’s capital which might explain why you’re having so much trouble. She is successfully countering every one of your plans. You’ve attempted to send a message to her, but you’ve yet to hear any kind of response  You don’t quite have enough strength to break through and you’re starting to stretch yourself a little thin. Reports tell you that other civilized nations are sending military detachments to help and another Grand Alliance army is on the way. At this point you’re either going to have to send for reinforcements yourself or retreat and regroup."
7397,45,"You don’t want Catalina to send any since you do need to defend your territory, so you figure the Ghoul King would be a good candidate. He can help you, before you help him destroy the Vampire Clans.  You send a message to him via ghostly courier and in the next day you get one back. He says he’ll be there soon, which relieves you a bit. In the meantime you continue to try to break through the capital’s defenses and repair some of your more salvageable troops that have fallen.  About a week passes and the Ghoul King hasn’t shown up yet, you’ve suffered a counter attack which allowed you to temporary replenish your troops, but you lost quite a few necromancers in the process. The strain of commanding such a large army is making you a little more fatigued than it would if you had some support. You send a message to the Ghoul King again as well as to Catalina. You don’t get anything back from the Ghoul King, but Catalina tells you she hasn’t heard from him either and she’s had to defend the home territory from Velzix who heard about how preoccupied you are with the Grand Alliance and is taking advantage of the situation.  A month passes and you have to retreat from the siege. You’re the last remaining necromancer and you’ve been running on empty. The Grand Alliance along with the Zalan military has completely decimated most of your troops with holy magic and powerful gunpowder weapons. You have to make your make back to Aftermath mostly through hostile territory now since most of your recent conquests have been liberated.  By the time you get to Aftermath you find it in ruins. It has been thoroughly raided by Velzix’s elite demon warriors. You rush in to check on Catalina, but you find her ripped to shreds by demons.  You cry out vowing revenge as you hold on to her body, but there will be no revenge for you. Your back is suddenly home to several stabbing blades. You attempt to turn around to face your attacker, and when you do your throat is slashed open. Clutching your throat you bleed out onto the floor before the vampire assassin completes the job and severs your head from your body."
7397,46,"As much as you’re loathed to do so, you decide it’s better to retreat and fortify your recent conquests. You’ve still done much damage to the Grand Alliance.  A month passes and you suffer counter attacks, and a few of your conquests get retaken, but for the most part you hold on to what you’ve acquired. Velzix takes advantage of the situation and decides to launch his own attacks on you and the Grand Alliance however, he’s a little more successful having managed to conserve his own manpower and not being stretched out  Catalina informs you that The Ghoul King has been itching to strike against the Vampire Clans and that he’s going to do it, with or without your direct help.  You’re too preoccupied with your own problems to even argue or do anything about it. You tell her that he can do what he’s gotta do. If he wants your help, Hessan and whatever pitiful army he can muster up is his to command. You don’t care.  Five years pass…  It’s been ten years since you took control of Aftermath and now it looks like that’s all finally coming to an end.  The Ghoul King’s assault upon the Vampire Clans was a failure, though it was damaging enough for them to never again bother you again. You have to move some necromancers into the Drozz region to take command there, which stretches you out a bit, since you didn’t need to worry about it so directly before, having the Ghoul King there and all.  Over the years Velzix managed to build up much strength while you and the Grand Alliance fought a see-saw battle. Velzix manages to permanently open up a large portal to his home plane. He declares all out war on the entire world determined to turn it into the same hell he once called home. You heard your Dad’s mercenary company attempted to stop him, but failed.  The Grand Alliance is the first to fall. Already weakened by your previous attacks, they could not put up much of a fight against the hordes of demons. You hear that your sister defended the capital of the Zalan Empire much like she did during your siege, except this time she was less successful and died. You can only presume your Mom suffered the same fate, seeing as she lived there as well. You hope that the pair of them have gone some place better  With the last bastion of “good” out of the way, Velzix turns his attention towards you. You won’t go without a fight though. For every bit of land he takes, you make him pay for it in demon blood tenfold.  It’s no use though, the hordes of hell are without end and while the dead are certainly just as numerous, you’re the only necromancer powerful enough to command epic armies of them and you are only one standing against hell itself.  Aftermath is besieged and ultimately falls to demonic armies. Catalina is killed during the attack and you disintegrate her body before escaping through a portal to Drozz as you refuse to let it be desecrated by demon scum.  You wage a guerilla war in Drozz for months, and you can’t help but realize you’ve become much like the Ghoul King; hiding in a hole while demons take over the world. For awhile you actually have some peace as the demons soon outnumber their “enemies” and begin to follow their natural instincts of in-fighting and you’re forgotten.  When the next winter comes you’re caught out in a heavy blizzard while foraging for food. You’re not going to make it back to your hiding place.  Exhausted, you fall in the snow thinking about the hell that the world has become and how you’re partially responsible. Eternal sleep is welcomed.  You embrace the blessed death that you once held mastery over."
7397,47,"The dark path isn’t an easy one and you’ve made (or rather inherited) lots of enemies besides the obvious ones due to what is now known as the “Nuro Incident”.  While you have many enemies, you realize you don’t have too many allies. Just you, your city and a sexy female necromancer.  Things could be worse!"
7397,48,"You remember Catalina in your Enchantment class, but you were so busy trying to pass it, that you barely paid any attention to her. Good thing you didn’t, otherwise you would’ve failed it. (Not that it really matters now!)  You’ve gotten to know her better since then of course. She’s a few years younger than you and grew up in the poor district of Nuro. Unlike you who had at least one loving parent, Catalina was an orphan. She did grow close to the kindly woman who ran the orphanage and took an interest in the woman’s minor magical abilities to entertain the children. This interest along with her natural ability, lead to Catalina’s path to become a magic practitioner.  However when this kindly lady was killed by thugs in the night, all the orphans were cast out on to the streets. Most of them turned to criminal lifestyles for survival. Catalina on the other hand was interested in a little more than just mere survival. She still had a thirst for magic knowledge, she left the slums far behind and began to she lurk around Nuro’s magic college, stealing books and trying to learn the secrets within. Even finding quiet places to practice minor spells. She was very isolated during these years and rarely interacted with others.  Eventually she stole a book from Mr. Demar. A book on necromancy. The magic contained within was nothing like she ever saw before. The philosophy of it was different as well. It fascinated her, and she couldn’t wait to practice it.  Fortunately she was caught red handed by Mr. Demar before she could. Mr. Demar sensed that she had much potential, but lacked discipline, so he decided to take her as one his pupils for his Dark Order. He even paid for her enrollment of other classes to give her a sense of stability and routine. She would stay in the underground base of the Dark Order so she could learn to better work in a group.  While all of this did make her a more organized person, she still never really connected with her peers. They were all a little older for one thing. She couldn’t identify with the demonologists and saw little in common with her fellow necromancers. Trelik’s arrogance and unwanted advances were a huge turn off. Sebastian and Irwin were okay, but seemed a little boring in the scheme of things. And while she appreciated Mr. Demar’s “generosity” and respected his abilities, she still never completely trusted him.  She’s still pretty guarded around you, though she does respect your abilities. (Much like how she felt about Mr. Demar actually) She’s a competent and moderately powerful necromancer. She tends to prefer to control small groups of elite undead troops rather than hordes of weak ones. She’s a little more versatile than you, as she has skill in other forms of magic. (Some of which she’s helped you at least be mediocre in)  As she’s the only one that’s at least approaching your level of power and a true necromancer as well, you feel closer to her and trust her to be your second in command and when something important needs to be done and if you can’t do it, you’ll assign it to her.   The former city of Nuro, now called Aftermath looks vastly different now of course, but you think it’s for the better.  Most of the “population” is dead and they go about their undead lives performing the same jobs they were typically doing before except now they never stop unless you command them to do something else.  A few of the dead do have higher brain functions, letting them able to make simple decisions. These you typically put in charge of guard duty or similar minor roles.  Your small group of necromancers takes care of any true “free will” undead problems by either corralling them, or bringing it to your attention to take care of it.  Other than the necromancers, there are no other living creatures in the city, at least not sentient ones. You won’t take the risk, at least not while Aftermath is your only holding."
7397,49,"You probably know Trelik the best out of all your enemies mainly because you were in the same class and he was jealous of your natural talent the whole time.  There isn’t too much to say about him other than he’s sadly all too typical of most necromancers: obsessed with power, arrogant, and suffers from delusions of grandeur. Catalina’s never liked him ever since he unsuccessfully hit on her before you had even joined the Dark Order. She liked him even less when he betrayed Mr. Demar.  Right now he’s rumored to have finally taken control of a little town in the Brot Kingdom. He’s been holding out so far due to the weak military the Kingdom has, but it’s unlikely he’d survive against the Grand Alliance.  So while he’s barely scraping together an army of dead peasants and dressed in smelly rags, you’re easily controlling a necropolis of dead soldiers and get to even share the company of a beautiful woman.  Nope he’s got no reason to hate you at all…   The former Tulan Kingdom has been turned into a hellish realm firmly under the grip of Demon Lord Velzix and his merry band of little demons.  From reports you’ve heard, the Kingdom was much like Nuro when it was attacked, completely unprepared. Velzix knew exactly what locations to attack first and took great glee in ripping the royal family to pieces personally.  Most of the Tulan population that wasn’t killed (or able to escape) submitted to Velzix almost immediately. A few of the Dark Order that had fled Nuro during the attack have also found a home there, however Velzix has made it quite clear of who is the master and who is the servant and has done twisted things to them to make them never forget. (Hence why most of the demonologists that were still in Nuro, ultimately decided to follow you instead!)  His army contains mortals (who were usually evil to begin with) and demons. So far he’s left you alone, but obviously that doesn’t mean you’re friends.  The Grand Alliance considers him to be at least as great a threat or possibly greater threat than you. The only thing that truly holds him back is the chaotic nature of his infernal buddies who seem to like fighting each other as well as their enemies. As it stands now, he’s only just holding on to his realm and fending off Grand Alliance attacks. He’s been unable to mount a real assault against any surrounding areas, though raids are typical.  If he ever got organized he’d definitely be public enemy number one and that’s something nobody wants."
7397,50,"Most of your knowledge of them comes from Catalina who being in the Dark Order longer had more information about them.  The Vampire Clans from what you know live in a fortress run by Lord Rostov. This fortress’ location is unknown and hidden by powerful magic. It is there where those few remaining vampires that have kept their faculties stay. (As opposed to the near mindless ones that lurk in holes in the wilderness)  While groups of vampires may have been involved in their own political intrigues and agendas in the past, the term Vampire Clans now is somewhat of a misnomer since Lord Rostov has a firm command over the remaining vampires. It’s basically a dictatorship more than a “council” where they all sit around discussing things. The term Clans is probably kept to just hold on to the illusion of former glory of freedom rather than the reality that they’re all hiding in a secret fortress ruled by a tyrant.  Despite their reduced power, they still can affect mortal affairs. Currently they are no doubt affecting these affairs to hinder you. The death of their delegate pissed them off pretty severely, not to mention they don’t agree with the “high profile” necromancy in the first place. You received a letter by bat from them recently saying that your actions will not go unopposed by the Clans and that your days on this world are numbered.   The self-professed “good guys” are made up of several civilized governments. The Zalan Empire (Your former home and where your family lives) is one of the main members of the Grand Alliance. Several races belong, each one bringing their unique skills to the mix. It’s quite possible to see the clockwork automatons of the Dwarven Union fighting side by side with the silent monks of Elin.  This arrangement only arises during times of great crisis such as the one you caused. Given that most living creatures have basic need to not want to die or become a walking rotting corpse (Or a slave to demons) the chances of you convincing them to leave you alone is extremely unlikely."
7397,51,"You might be a competent necromancer, but you’re leery about messing around with time. You better help Mr. Demar so he can better deal with the possible Quayle situation.  You head towards campus where various explosions are taking place, it doesn’t take long before you encounter Sebastian lying on the ground. You guess he attempted to help Mr. Demar and got killed for his troubles.  “Damn, sorry about that.” You say and then raise him to join your horde and hope Catalina is doing a better job with Quayle.  You enter the administration building. Smoke, fire and body parts look all around. In the distance you hear shouting followed by magic blasts.  “TRELIK YOU TREACHEROUS BASTARD!” “Ha ha! You’re weak old man and I’m taking over this shit!”  You order your undead horde to run ahead of you as you approach the sounds of battle. You turn the corner just in time for Trelik run into you, he’s definitely caught off guard.  “YOU! You little sycophant come to help teacher eh, well it won’t…”  You don’t listen to his melodramatic speeches, you tell your horde to kill him and they do so easily given that he’s heavily outnumbered and can’t cast a spell quick enough. Mr. Demar arrives just in time to see the aftermath.  “Damn, I was hoping to kill him myself. No matter, what’s done is done now. Our enemies here are defeated. Most of the high ranking professors have been killed, I’m just looking for that cowering Dean. Have you secured the city?” “Yeah, I personally stormed city hall and slew the first citizen and all of his mage guards.” “Ha ha! I knew you had potential!” Mr. Demar laughs and pats you on the shoulder. “Mr. Demar I think you should know something. Quayle’s spell is becoming erratic, someone said buildings are starting to phase in and out of existence. I think Jasmine’s over there, but I don’t think she’ll be able to handle what’s going on.” “Dammit, I’d hoped that Quayle was stable enough to…aaargh! Nevermind, I’ll have to take care of this, because if his actions go completely wrong we’re all dead. Since you seem to be good at killing high officials, you take care of the dean.”  Mr. Demar takes his leave towards the eastside of campus, leaving you to take out the dean. You’re a little unsure of yourself, the dean of the university didn’t get that way by being a push over. Though Mr. Demar did say he was cowering somewhere so maybe he’s not that tough. You tell your undead troops to spread out and search the building. Along the way you see Felsa’s body. Oh well, another follower for you…  You begin to grow tired of searching mundane office after mundane office so it’s a treat when you once again hear the sounds of battle and see the dean at the end of a corridor fighting off your horde.   “Back, foul things!” The dean shouts casting a ray of pure light in the faces of many of your troops.  He hasn’t seen you yet so you take advantage and cast your own blast of negative energy into his side. He falls in pain, but returns fire which you barely dodge. He crawls out of your line of sight and behind a corner.  “So Demar sends one of his students to take care of me, too cowardly to do it himself eh? It’ll take more than a few skeletons and a neophyte necromancer to bring me down! Come and get me if you dare!”  You have to kill him while he’s still weak, if you let him regain energy he could possibly escape, or worse, kill you."
7397,52,"You decide the best way is to take the straight forward approach and just overwhelm the dean. You raise more nearby bodies and add them to your tireless horde. As they march down the corridor, you stand near the end of the corridor figuring, if the dean comes out to cast a fireball he won’t get you. However you severely underestimated the dean.  He does indeed come out from behind the corner again and he casts a very powerful version of chain lightning, it zaps through your troops, not really doing anything except halting them briefly and rattling their dead bones, however when the lightning reaches YOU, you feel the effects a lot more severely as every organ in your body is fried and your skin is charred black.  You fall to the floor dead and your horde soon follows."
7397,53,"You always meant to try this, but never got around to it. No time like the present…  You concentrate and attempt to summon the spirits of the nearby dead to help you kill the dean. At first nothing seems to happen and you hear the dean killing more of your skeletons and walking corpses, but soon an eerie howl is heard.  Several tormented ghostly beings rise up and you give them the simple order to kill. It takes a bit more concentration to control them, but you manage. The dean is surprised by the ghosts and fumbles with an appropriate spell, but isn’t quick enough before they touch him and his life force begins to drain. Eventually he becomes a desicated husk and drops to the floor.  “Damn that was cool.” You giggle.  Feeling totally pleased with your victory, you then remember Mr. Demar and Quayle’s spell. You’d blocked it out of your mind during the battle, but you’re hoping that’s been resolved.  You head towards the eastside of campus, and you see no disturbance, at least no buildings disappearing and reappearing. You do see Catalina standing by though; she sees you and waves you over.  “Wow, you’re back, I guess that means you killed the dean huh?” Catalina questions. “You sound surprised.” “Hmm, I guess maybe I’m a little impressed.” “What’s going on?” “I dunno, I’m not sure myself, it was really weird. When I first got here I couldn’t get to Quayle due to all the temporal disturbances, I was about to leave when Mr. Demar arrived, he told me to stand back and he would take care of this. He managed to walk straight into that gray building over there where I assume Quayle was. I saw Mr. Demar become a child, a rotting corpse and then revert back to his normal age before he got there. I then heard terrible noises within. I even saw some strange tentacled creatures come out of the building. I thought I was going to have to fight them, but then the entire mess just seemed to stop and there wasn’t a disturbance anymore. I guess Mr. Demar won…but I haven’t checked on him, I’m still hesitant about going near there.” “Well I guess I’ll go in then.”  You enter the gray building cautiously, you see a bunch of little centipedes crawling all over the place, some really slimy yellow ichor and just a general feeling of sickness. You’ve seen a lot in the Dark Order, but whatever happened here was really fucked up.  You attention is turned to Mr. Demar who is on the floor…or rather IN the floor. Half of his body is embedded in the stone floor, you don’t see how you can help him.  “Shit! What the hell?” you exclaim. “Ugh…long story…look there isn’t much time. (Cough) This take over has been a failure.” “No it hasn’t, we got the whole city, I killed the dean, and you stopped this temporal disturbance…” “I haven’t stopped it, at least not permanently. The damage done was far too severe by the time I got here. Quayle’s actions have ripped open a hole to a place you don’t even want to know about. (Cough) I’ve temporarily patched it up, but who knows how long it will last. You better get out of here while you still can…I won’t lie though, life for you is going to be rough. You’ll be hunted when they find out what happened here and they WILL find out about you. They always do. Still, you may survive. You are powerful, maybe you’ll be able to succeed where I failed…but I doubt it. Ugh…the odds…just too great…you want my last advice? Take that Catalina girl and have fun while you can.”  And with that last bit of advice Mr. Demar dies.  Well this was a big downer. Here you thought you were ready to take on the world and then you find out all your actions have been for naught! Still, what does Mr. Demar know? He’s dead! Perhaps you can find a way to fix the hole permanently or at least keep it patched. It seems folly to just abandon this city after having risked so much to gain it.  Then again perhaps it would be better to follow Mr. Demar’s advice. If you leave now, it might take awhile before your identities are discovered. Life on the run isn’t going to be easy, but perhaps it won’t be forever."
7397,54,"You exit the gray building and approach Catalina, she looks at you expectantly.  “So what’re we going to do?” “We’re taking over this city. From now on, it’s you and me.” You reply.  Catalina is taken aback by your orders, given all of what has happened she senses that staying in the city wouldn’t be the best plan. But she has no other allies. She has no idea of where to run. She will stick with you, if only because together you’ll be a more formidable force when trouble surely arises.  You and Catalina prepare yourselves for the trouble ahead…  A month passes The Incident of Nuro has finally become well known knowledge. You and Catalina have managed to shore up the defenses of Nuro pretty well, all things considered. Some of the demonologists help out, but only because they have nowhere else to go and this is the safest place for them. You begin to instruct them to learn the ways of necromancy. You also manage to turn back a Grand Alliance army which didn’t expect such a large resistance. The demons that left the city ran amok all over the countryside and took a particular interest in the Kingdom of Tulan under the guidance of Velzix, an arch fiend. Which is fortunate since it draws a little attention away from you.  No signs of that “temporal hole” opening up again, but you tell some of your new acolytes to keep an eye on it. In the mean time nothing of importance is to be placed in that area.  A year passes The Kingdom of Tulan has finally put the sword to every last demon infesting the area, which doesn’t bode well for you since now you’re the only “big evil” around now.  The Grand Alliance attempts another siege of the city and once again they fail. You aren’t confident you can hold out forever like this though, you attempt to claim that you have no plans for conquest, but your claims (true or not) go unheeded. They aren’t taking any chances that you might build up.  You and Catalina have at this point basically become “King and Queen” of the city. It’s a logical pairing. Sometimes though it’s more than just one of convenience.  Your acolytes warn you about seeing strange things. Object temporarily disappearing. You begin to worry and unlock those old tomes that Quayle was reading hoping you can learn something.  Another years passes You suffer two more attacks by the Grand Alliance. The last one lead by your own sister. You attempted to parley with her before battle, but she would have none of it. Indeed you received a letter from your Mom a month before the attack begging you to give yourself up. Of course you couldn’t do that. You wrote her back with regret and told her that you shall probably not speak again.  Your sister got farther than most, but in the end she died by your own hand. You didn’t raise her. She was not deserving of such a fate. You burned her body instead and wished her well in the afterlife.  How you wished that your Dad’s mercenary company had been sent, but for whatever reason you have not heard anything from him. The coward. He knows you are more powerful and could easily crush him.  The temporal disturbances are getting worse, and you’re not learning anything new from Quayle’s books, it’s all just so damn confusing. You feel like you did when you were in school. Completely inept and helpless.  Catalina tries to be understanding, but your behavior from reading the damn books is making you very erratic. She has to pick up the slack when you begin to make mistakes.  Another year passes   The temporal hole rips open once again. Horrible creatures come lurching out. You manage to fight them off, but the hole is getting bigger. Catalina insists that you both have to leave the city, but you’re too far gone at this point, the books on temporal magic have begun to make you as mad as they did Quayle. (If without the talent) This is your city and you’re bound and determined to hold it no matter what.  She cannot endure anymore; she takes her leave of you one night…only to be killed by vampire assassins somewhere in the countryside.  The Grand Alliance is preparing to attack again, more tentacle creatures are seeping into this reality. You don’t care; you’ll take them all on.  You laugh insanely on your throne as the screams and unnatural howls fill the city. Battle and death is everywhere. You hear something coming up the stairs, and it’s probably not Grand Alliance soldiers…  “What was the point of it all? Nothing!” you laugh before being utterly destroyed."
7397,55,"You exit the gray building and approach Catalina, she looks at you expectantly.  “So what’re we going to do?” “We’re getting out of here, and we’re not looking back. From now on, it’s you and me.” You reply.  Catalina is taken aback by your orders, but given all of what has happened she senses that staying in the city wouldn’t be the best plan. She too has no other allies. She will stick with you, if only because together you’ll be a more formidable force when trouble surely arises.  You and Catalina leave the decimated city of Nuro behind you…   A month passes The Incident of Nuro has finally become well known knowledge. A few demonologists attempted to run the hollow shell of the city, but severely lacked any sort of manpower, natural or unnatural to hold it. They were easily defeated when the Grand Alliance army came to retake the city. The demons that left the city ran amok all over the countryside and took a particular interest in the Kingdom of Tulan under the guidance of Velzix, an arch fiend.  You and Catalina still remain unknown as far as being involved, but other members of the Dark Order that escaped are starting to be hunted down…  A year passes The Kingdom of Tulan has finally put the sword to every last demon infesting the area. Most of the demonologist have been caught and hung for their crimes as well. Your name has also come up on the wanted list along with Catalina’s.  You both now keep to the rural locations; many times you have to fend off attacks from barbaric orc tribes. Fortunately your skills in necromancy protect you (as well as scare the hell out of the orcs)  Despite the hardship (Or perhaps because of it) you and Catalina form a sort of relationship beyond one of just mutual protection. There are times when you forget that you’re being hunted constantly.  Two years pass Just like Mr. Demar predicted a temporal disturbance in the city of Nuro reappears again. Horrible creatures come lurching out creating a “Second Incident” before the time hole is repaired for good. However the city is evacuated due to mass insanity caused there and is considered a danger zone under observation by the Grand Alliance.  Catalina is killed by vampire assassins during the night, you take vengeance, but it’s too late for her. You weep for the first time in a long time. You briefly flirt with the idea of raising her…but you burn her body instead and carry on your path alone.  And all you can think about is how tired you are…  Two more years pass You hear them coming for you, there is no more running. This is your fate. To die in this cave. You don’t even want to fight it anymore. You regret the day you set out on this path.  Such is often the fate of a necromancer."
7397,56,"Sensing impending doom, you decide your best course of action is to escape. You immediately take your undead horde and fight your way out of the city. You then attempt to put as much distance as you can between you and Nuro. You curse the day you decided to fuck around with the dark arts. Where are you going to go now? You have no idea, but you can’t be seen walking around the countryside with a bunch of rotting corpses in tow.  Quickly you dismiss your small army, which instantly collapses back to death and you run to the nearest settlement.  You get to the town of Selawag, which is part of the Brot Kingdom. You enter an inn there with no problems. It would appear that the news of what’s happened hasn’t traveled here yet, but you know it won’t be long. And then how long will it be before someone finds out that you were involved? You suppose it’s possible that you could escape without suspicion, but it’s unlikely. The hunters always find out. They always know.  And life on the run, is what you have to look forward to now. You’ll have to constantly move, and never rest. You prepare yourself for your new life…  A month passes The Incident of Nuro has finally become well known knowledge. The take over was a failure, but the damage done was severe. A temporal disturbance in the heart of the city has made the entire area unstable as buildings phase in and out of existence. Two of the well known culprits Mr. Demar and Felsa were killed in battle. A third, Trelik escaped and is considered to be at large. Many of the Dark Order were either killed or went into hiding. Demons are running amok all over the countryside and have taken particular interest in the Kingdom of Tulan.  A year passes The Kingdom of Tulan has finally put the sword to every last demon infesting the area. Necromancer Trelik was finally hunted down and killed after he was cornered in a small village that he’d turned into his own personal domain. Most of the demonologist have been caught and hung for their crimes as well. Your name has also come up on the wanted list along with the two remaining necromancers involved: Sebastian and Catalina.  You now keep to the rural locations; many times you barely survive attacks from barbaric orc tribes. Fortunately your skills in necromancy protect you (as well as scare the hell out of the orcs)  Two years pass Nuro has completely collapsed in on itself due to the temporal disturbance leaving nothing but a gaping hole there; a war breaks out in the nearby area.  Sebastian took his own life as the Retlad Guard beat down his door. Catalina was found dead by an unknown assassin. Nobody knows who, but it wasn’t by any government. You have a good idea though, considering you have been attacked several times by vampire assassins during the night.  Two more years pass You hear them coming for you, there is no more running. This is your fate. To die in this cave. You don’t even want to fight it anymore. You regret the day you set out on this path.  Such is often the fate of a necromancer."
7397,57,"“No that’s okay.” You say not wishing to cause trouble. Mr. Demar frowns a bit, but accepts your decision.  “Very well, I guess you’re with me Trelik, and for fuck’s sake don’t be so damn hostile this time. These matters have to be handled with care!”  As they leave to the conference room, you go back to practicing your lessons. While you’re in the middle of them you and the rest of the students soon hear some noise and the sounds of battle.  “DAMN IT TRELIK IF YOU’RE GONNA KILL THE SONOFABITCH, AT LEAST GET IT RIGHT!” you hear Mr. Demar yell.  You and a few of the other student go running toward the conference room, a figure runs at you in flames!  He smashes into you wailing horribly setting you on fire as well, you can’t get him off of you in time before you begin to burn up, but it hardly matters as Trelik soon comes to finish off the vampire delegate…and you as well with another fireball.  “Sorry Mr. Demar, couldn’t be helped.”"
7397,58,"Chapter 2: Hellbound  Serena’s advice might’ve pointed you in the right direction, but as far as you needing the help of others you’re going to take a pass on that. You don’t need anyone else except yourself. That’s the way it’s been for a long time and that’s the way it’s going to stay.  That leaves you to go where various other students have gone when they want to get something illegal and keep it to themselves. “Big Red”.  Technically Big Red isn’t actually all that big, in fact for a demon he’s probably on the smaller size, but like most demons he likes to think he’s very important. Big Red typically hangs around in the seedy parts of Nuro, but he also hangs around the park area on campus late at night. His presence in Nuro is barely tolerated, but he’s been known to acquire things for high ranking officials and provide important information that is beneficial to Nuro security.  Oddly for all his mercenary criminal behavior he’s tight lipped for a demon and will only tell on someone if asked directly and only then for the right price. Given how low profile you are, it’s unlikely anyone’s going to ask about you, let alone what for. Chances are if anyone does see you with Big Red they’ll just think you’re another college student looking to get high.  You wait until night and then stalk the campus park area looking for Big Red, but instead he finds you, catching you off guard.  “Y’know you’d look less guilty if you weren’t lurking around like a damn dark elf assassin. Haven’t seen you around before, I guess that explains why you’re coming to me AFTER finals are over. Most students come and get the answers before hand y’know.” “You sell those? Damn, I didn’t have to fail my nature test final after all.” “I could probably fix that too, for a price of course.” “…maybe, but what I’m looking for is uh…a little different.” “Ah, so high exactly do you want to get?” “No, not that…” “Well, I’m not selling sex slaves if that’s what you’re looking for…well at least not here.” “No! I’m looking for something different!”  Big Red gives you a strange look.  “Okay, what kind of freak are you exactly then?” “I’m looking for something on Necromancy.”  Big Red throws you up against a tree when you make that remark and begins to whisper to you in a harsh tone. You can feel (And smell) the brimstone emanating from his breath.  “You fucking little mortal pissant, you trying to get me killed? I don’t sell that shit! Get the fuck outta here!” he says before throwing you on the ground and walking away.  Now it may be that he’s telling the truth, but he may be more worried that you’re trying to set him up. You’re determined to find out regardless of the consequences. You run back to him, but stay out of his immediate range.  “Look, I know you’re a guy who can get a hold of lots of things and I also know you’re available for a price. I’m not a spy, I’m not gonna rat you out, I’m not working for anyone, I just have a…need…”  Big Red turns back towards you and walks in your direction, you think he’s going to attack and you nearly run, but chances are he’d catch you first anyway. He’s looking around in all directions and speaking in a low tone.  “Alright. Look. Since you’re obviously new and not hip to how this works, I’m inclined to believe you’re not working for someone. Someone undercover wouldn’t be so obviously clueless as you seem to be, at least not to catch the likes of me. Plus I can sense the darkness around you…it’s a neat ability we have and again let’s us tell who’s a goody two shoes and who isn’t. You don’t seem to be either though just yet. You seem to be more confused and curious than anything which is almost as bad.” “So you can’t you help me?” “It’s not that I can’t, it’s whether I should. This isn’t selling you some Hobgoblin Hashish so you can go get high and wind up naked the next morning with a Dwarf in your ass.” “Um…what? Excuse me?” you stutter at Big Red’s odd scenario outcome. “This is serious shit, if word got around that I was selling information on the Dark Arts, let alone books on it, my ass would be strung up and killed. And to have some dumb ass college student fucking around with something as dangerous as that is asking for trouble since YOU’RE probably going to get yourself caught, which will then lead to possible questions before they kill you…which can then link to me. And that can’t happen.” “I’m not going to get caught.” “Hah! Heard that one before from people getting busted for less. I dunno, I don’t see you as a good risk and even if I did consider this request my price would be VERY high and I don’t see you as having that kind of money to spend.”  Big Red’s denials of your request are actually making you want what he has even more. You KNOW he can help you. In fact you’re beginning to get irritated. Why the hell is he denying you this? He’s a fucking demon who sells illegal shit! He shouldn’t care at all! You’re desperate for his help though so you tell an outlandish lie.  “Look my parents are rich! I can get the money for you, just gimme your price and I can get it…it might take me awhile, but I can get it.” “Oh you can huh? Alright then I’ll play your game. He’s my price.” Big Red pulls out a little pad of paper and pencil and writes something on it and then hands it to you. You read the astronomical price while Big Red’s face turns into a smug demonic grin. He probably did that for dramatic effect.  There’s no way you can pay this, even if you somehow managed to convince your parents to give you money to support your grossly illegal studies in necromancy. You’re not going to let it stop you though.  “Wow…that is high…okay. I can get this, but it’ll take me a few days.” You say feigning a mixture of shock, but calmness too. Big Red himself looks surprised that you agreed. He begins to write down something on his pad again and gives it to you.  “Well alright money bags, we got a deal. You come meet me at this time and location in a week. If you ain’t there, then you can forget about coming to see me for anything ever again. If you come and you don’t have the money…well I don’t think I need to stress how bad that would be. So my advice is if you don’t have it, don’t show. See ya.” “Hey wait, you said you can fix my grade too.” You suddenly remember. “Don’t you think you’ve spent enough money tonight? Alright then maybe you ARE made of gold after all, so what’s the class?” “Nature magic.” “Oh yeah, you said that. Yeah, that’s definitely doable, mainly because the professor is, I just need to slip the deviled ham into her and she’ll be willing to pass anyone.” “I thought she was a lesbian.” “Feh, not when it comes to Big Red. It ain’t just a name ya know. Alright, my price for this task is two hundred gold pieces. Normally I might charge less, but hey you got the money right?”  Indeed, but you don’t have much now after forking it over to Big Red. You were hoping the gold you brought was going to go towards a necromantic tome, but instead it’s just going to cheating.  “Thanks, and as appreciation for your generous business tonight, I think I’ll go take care of that grade situation of yours right now, if I’m lucky maybe she’ll have one of those little elven bitches with her. Ha ha!”  As Big Red leaves you, you head back to your apartment to scheme for the rest of the week. You go through a wide variety of emotions: fear, anger, desire, anxiety, obsession, etc. None of it really means anything though since you don’t really have too much in the way of choices now. You’re either going to have to kill Big Red when you go to meet him, or just forget about this necromancy stuff and go home for vacation."
7397,59,"While all the other students are on their way home for vacation, you’re planning a murder…  You’re in this all the way now. You’ve decided that you can’t live life as you have been. You have to take this chance, regardless of the consequences. You’re just wondering how the hell you’re going to go about killing Big Red. He’s not going to be a push over and is probably more than a match for most college students, let alone one who can barely cast spells competently in first place.  Still, you must try. You get one of your oversized back packs and begin stuffing it with rocks. The only plan you have is when he asks to see the money, you’ll tell him you got it in gemstones, throw it at him to catch it and then unleash a blast of lightning in his face.  After that you’re going to hope for the best.  You head down to the location given to you by Big Red. Even though Nuro is a prosperous city, it still has its “bad parts” and right now you’re walking in one of them. You half expect to get mugged by orcs at any moment; you almost wish your sister was with you.  Eventually you get to the location, you’re already nervous about all this and walking through this neighborhood just made you more so. However, this dilapidated house that you’re currently standing in front of looks like its shown signs of battle recently. The door is smashed open and there’s a whiff of charred flesh coming from the broken windows.  “Heeeeeey….(hic!) youz ain’t goin’ in dere is ya?” some drunken goblin lying by some trash cans nearby utters. “This is Big Red’s house isn’t it?” “(hic!) Nope, his girlfriend lives here, well one of ‘em anyway.” “What happened here?” “Shit. (hic!) Fuck if I know. I was passed out for most of it, but I heard some screams a couple of magic blasts and well…(hic!) a whole buncha shit really.” “Is Big Red in there?” “Dunno, I think I heard his voice…didn’t sound good either. (hic!) Guess it all caught up to him. Here’s to Red! Demon Bastard! (hic!) Hope dey didn’t kill his pretty little girlfrien’ doh. She was swee-eet!” the goblin says and takes another drink out of his pocket. “Nobody’s come out here, to investigate?” “Har har! Datsh a good one boy! Come out here? Man those mage guards like us poor folks killing each other. Ain’t nobody gonna show up here probably for like a few days. (hic!) fuckin…no good (mumble mumble)”  As the goblin wino lapses back into an alcoholic coma, you cautiously enter the house.  The house is a wreck. Though you get the impression it wasn’t a palace to begin with. You look on the floor and see Big Red. You also see him on the walls and even the ceiling. Whoever wanted him dead, made sure of it.  Of course this doesn’t exactly help you get what you wanted to get from him. Not knowing what else to do, you begin to search the house, but you’re not finding too much, but for some reason you sense you aren’t completely alone in this house. Someone is still here.  You stand completely silent and listen carefully, then you see a blood trail leading to the bedroom closet…  “Alright, I know someone is in the closet, I can hear the stifled cries. Just come out, and I won’t hurt you. I just want to know what happened to Big Red and some information.” You shout.  The closet slowly opens and you see a young human woman crawl out, she’s hurt badly and you don’t think you can help her in time. She looks up at you with tears in her eyes.  “I’ve nothing more to give…they’ve taken everything…I am dead…I have nothing else…” she sobs. “Who came? What’s going on?” “That damn college professor and his Dark Order that’s who! Mr. Demar! He and Big Red have had dealings for years in forbidden tomes and the dark arts. Well Mr. Demar said since their business was nearly at an end he demanded that Big Red just hand over all the rest of his collection. Violence soon followed. It was horrible what they did… I only lived this long by playing dead (sob)…but then I just wanted to crawl into a dark place and die.”  This bit of information is very interesting, but you still have to figure out how it can serve you.  “What does Mr. Demar have planned?” “I don’t know! Something about restoring the rightful place of those who practice the dark arts. I don’t care! They took my whole life away! Maybe it wasn’t much, and maybe Big Red was a demon asshole…but I loved him and in his way, he loved me! I’ll never know!” the girl cries.  You feel slightly bad about coming here to try to kill Big Red now. This girl’s feelings while most likely misguided seem to be genuine. Just proving that even the lowliest of scoundrels can be loved. Your mind briefly thinks about Serena before addressing this situation again.  “Okay, look shhhh. I’m sure Big Red probably did love you. He was a demon though, you know he had to put on a show and act tough.” You say. “…(sniff) yeah…You’re absolutely right. You are right….mmm I’m sleepy…” She says as her eyes begin to start closing. “Hold on, before you go to sleep, I need to know something. Big Red was holding a book for me too, a book on necromancy. I was coming to pay him and pick it up here. It sounds like Mr. Demar was trying to rip the both of us off and that ain’t no way of doing business. I mean to get revenge on the lot of them that killed Big Red, but I’ll need the help of that book, you don’t happen to know where it is, do you?” “…oh…yeah, you must be the one that Big Red briefly mentioned before they came…I dunno, they searched the house, maybe they got it, but it would be in a small hidden floor safe behind the toilet. Ha ha…nobody searches behind a toilet Red used to say…I love you Big Red…” The girl says and then closes her eyes and stops breathing.  Poor girl, you think as you leave her to search the bathroom. You curse as soon as you look behind the toilet and see a small panel open. You’re so frustrated you nearly miss the false bottom of the safe…    Jackpot. You pry up the false bottom and greedily grab the tome you were looking for, in fact there are a few other books there too, but you only keep the necromantic ones, and destroy the rest as you have no interest in demon summoning. (And not going to let anyone else use them either!)  You pour out the rocks in your backpack and place the books inside; you’re now ready to go back home. Or are you?  In your last minute peruse you search the remains of Big Red, and as luck would have it, you find his infamous pad and paper still somewhat intact. You briefly glance through it and make out one other address, not too far from here. It could be his real home or maybe just another place where he stashed stuff. Either way it could be lucrative."
7397,60,"You head to your apartment where you study your acquired books until morning and then sleep for the entire day.  When you wake up you write a letter to your family saying that you’re going to be staying at Nuro for vacation since you have some extra curricular studying to do and a big opportunity could be opening up. You mostly study your necromantic books and absorbing the knowledge within.  You keep up with local news and the deaths of Big Red and his girlfriend are barely mentioned. You gather that you’re in the clear.  Next week you get a letter in return from your Mom who says she’s disappointed you won’t be coming to visit, but pleased that you’re doing well and your grades are back up. (At least Big Red came through for you on the nature magic thing before he died) She also mentions how proud she is of you.  If she only knew…  A month passes and you’ve almost finished the books you acquired, but you haven’t been able to do any practicing which is something you desperately want to do. You feel like you got all this power within you and you’re being forced not to use it.  You’re so hot on raising some corpses you’re on the verge of doing something rash. You ponder going to the local graveyard which is really risky given that there are always guards on duty and magical monitors in place to prevent such things from easily occurring.  Your other alternative is to kill someone and then raise them."
7397,61,"The city isn’t as busy now since most of the students have left, so maybe you won’t have too many problems.  Initially all goes well. You sneak into the graveyard at night, managing to avoid the guards. You then break into one of the mausoleums where you hope you can find some easily accessible coffins.  You shut the door and pry open one of them trying to be as quiet as possible. The skeletal remains inside are calling to you.  You take out your book and begin to cast your spell and within no time at all the skeleton inside begins to rise. Success! And it barely took any effort at all. You were born for this!  You open up another nearby coffin and raise another one. Two skeletons! You’re controlling two at a time with no problems! You’re positively euphoric.    Of course you’ve been making a lot of noise. Noise that one of the guards hears and comes to investigate, when he sees the door lock broken and opens it, he sees you.  “NECROMANCER!” he screams and runs away!  You don’t care that you’ve been caught though. You’re ready to show the world what you’re really made of! You begin the chant and cast, and all that other stuff you’ve been reading about. You’re going to raise an army to swarm this city and take it over! None shall oppose you! And if Mr. Demar gets in your way, you’ll crush him too!  Soon you’re raising the dead from their graves, and even though you’re a “natural” at this, you’re still shy of practice so you have a bit of a hard time controlling so many. By the time you reach the hundreds, you’re losing control over most of them and you have to leave the graveyard to save your own life.  You march down the street with the dead horde you do have control over causing havoc on a small scale. You have some fun reveling in the terror you’re bringing, but it is short sighted and not to last.  The Nuro mage guards soon arrive on the scene and they don’t fuck around. They use every spell against you, destroying entire blocks in an effort to bring you down. It is at this point you realize that you’ve handled this poorly.  When you’ve lost your last corpse, you attempt to run away only to bump into a few of the dead that had wandered away from your control. In a kind of ironic justice, you are killed before you can reestablish your dominance over them."
7397,62,"You were planning on killing Big Red and he was a demon, you think you’ll be able to handle killing someone else that’s less formidable.  You head back to the seedy part of Nuro at night. There are plenty of winos and ladies of the evening you can kill and then practice on.  You enter the alleys like some common murderer and begin to do your dirty work on those unfortunate enough to be in the general area. You typically drag these victims into some abandoned building and cast your spells.  You do this over the course of a month before one night while you’re raising another prostitute you’re walked in on by some common thugs who were using the building you were in as a hide out.  “Oh shit! That’s Tina! I wondered what happened to her, she was my favorite whore!” “And that’s a fucking necromancer! Let’s get outta here!” “Fuck that, I don’t back down from shit!”  You order your dead whore to attack one thug and then blast another with a beam of negative energy. The last one escapes screaming about a necromancer.  “Well, I guess it’s time to play…” you giggle and raise the two thugs to join you.  You march through the slums killing everyone; it’s all so easy for you. You don’t feel a challenge; your dead horde just grows as you fill its ranks with the poor. You aren’t even fatigued, you feel invincible and you’re now determined to bring death to the entire city. No one can oppose you and if Mr. Demar and his Dark Order tries too, they’ll get the same, for you’re going to be the head necromancer in this city!    Soon your horde is numbering in the hundreds and you’ve drawn the attention of Nuro’s mage guards at last. They do everything in their power to stop you, even leveling entire blocks to get to you. It’s at that point you realize you might be in over your head.  You continue to fight however, you refuse to give up, but the odds are too great, and eventually a single sniper on a rooftop with a crossbow takes aim and pieces your skull, putting an end to your petty desires of conquest and your necromancer career."
7397,63,"Thirsting for more possible knowledge you head to this new address. This time you’re not in a residential area and more in a warehouse district, still not a safe area though.  When you get to the warehouse, once again the signs of battle abound, except this time it would appear that you arrived in the middle of one still going on.  “Don’t just stand there, the fucking thing, damn it!” “Shit! Thing’s too fucking tough!” “Well summon another…arrrggh!”   You enter cautiously and see a huge stone golem battling a couple people in robes. One lies on the floor dead. Given the dead imps that also litter the room, they’re probably demonologist. Some of Mr. Demar’s no doubt.  You stand back and watch the battle from the shadows, staying hidden the whole time. While keeping an eye on the battle you take out one of your necromantic books and quickly glance through it. You come across a spell that allows you cast a bolt of pure negative energy. It seems pretty easy, so you decide to try it.  You come out from behind the boxes you were using as cover and blast the golem in the face with a powerful beam of dark energy. Its head explodes into several stone pieces, but it doesn’t stop. Such a hit will not automatically kill a creature like this. The demonologists look surprised to see you and even more surprised when you bark orders at them.  “Get it now! While it’s blind! Take its legs!” you shout.  They do exactly what you say and cast super hot blasts to the golem’s knees burning right through them, causing the rest of it to collapse and shatter. It’s definitely dead now.  “Whew! Good thing you came along. When Mr. Demar sent us to search this address we didn’t expect to encounter a golem guard. How did he know to send help?” one of the demonologists asks. “He didn’t.” you say and blast him. “Hey…” is all the other manages to utter before you blast him as well.  You’re now left alone in a warehouse with multiple dead bodies, and as a certain goblin wino once said, the mage guard probably won’t be coming around here anytime soon. You see this as a perfect opportunity to practice some REAL necromancy.  You open the page to the appropriate spell and begin the cast it. Soon one of the dead demonologists begins to rise. It doesn’t even take you much effort to control him. It’s very easy actually. You’ve never had such an easy time at any kind of magic before, but this feels so right to you.  You summon the second one and then the third one. You command them to do various things for you just to see how well you can control them. It barely takes you any concentration at all.  You spend the rest of the night practicing, before making a search of the place which as it turns out contains nothing, but banned pornographic writings. You then head to your apartment where you sleep for the entire day.  When you wake up you write a letter to your family saying that you’re going to be staying at Nuro for vacation since you have some extra curricular studying to do and a big opportunity could be opening up. You mostly study your necromantic books and absorbing the knowledge within.  You keep up with local news and the deaths of Big Red and his girlfriend are barely mentioned, and nothing is mentioned of the warehouse. You gather that you’re in the clear.  Next week you get a letter in return from your Mom who says she’s disappointed you won’t be coming to visit, but pleased that you’re doing well and your grades are back up. (At least Big Red came through for you on the nature magic thing before he died) She also mentions how proud she is of you.  If she only knew…  A month passes and you’ve almost finished the books you acquired. You can’t really do too much practicing though, which is something you desperately want to do again. You know you’ve got all this power within you yet you can’t use it.  The problem is dead bodies aren’t exactly something you can just come across. Oh sure you could go to the graveyard, but that would most likely attract a ton of attention given that most of them are always monitored to prevent such things from easily happening. You wonder if you should approach Mr. Demar and join his Dark Order. While you typically don’t work with groups, but if it gets you some practice maybe it would be worth joining. Plus you’d get to find out what’s going on with all that, since it seems like something you should worry about.  Then again large groups tend to get targeted first. So maybe you could try summoning spirits. It’s not like they’re as obvious. Though from what you’ve read controlling such incorporeal dead requires more experience and you haven’t been able to practice a lot."
7397,64,"As they say there is strength in numbers.  You head over to the campus to seek out Mr. Demar. You figure he’ll be in his office. You knock and he tells you to come in and shut the door behind you. When you do, he’s surprised to see you.  “Hello. This is bit of a surprise. You took my class two semesters ago and I would’ve thought that you’d be on vacation now instead of here. So what brings you to my office?”  You decide to get straight to the point.  “Mr. Demar, I want to join the Dark Order. I’m skilled in necromancy and I want to learn more. I think I’d make a worthy addition to your class.”  Mr. Demar says nothing for a minute and just studies you before speaking.  “I see, and how do you know that I am the head of such an…organization.” “Well, uh I’ve heard rumors that’s all…” you quickly say. “Rumors eh? Such rumors going around about me would be very dangerous to my well being. Hope this isn’t a common rumor.”  You’re silent to this statement, as you’re unsure of what to say. Mr. Demar continues for you though.  “And tell me, if I was head of such an organization, you say I would want you? How is it that you are skilled in the ways of necromancy? How have you managed to train? Do you have access to the dead and possession of necromantic texts? How did you come across such things?” “Well uh…I don’t like to mention this…but I have an ancestor who served under the Great Lich Lord and a couple of books of his have been in my family’s possession for centuries.” “Well now, necromantic tomes from the era of the Great Lich Lord himself! I am impressed. And you say you had an ancestor who served under him eh? That’s even more impressive considering the Great Lich Lord eventually grew to loathe anything alive and only associated with the dead. That was why he was bringing death to the world in the first place. Such an ancestor would’ve had to been undead an unable to have children.” “Uh…well he had ‘em before becoming undead.” “Okay, but his family would’ve had to join his fate and hence they also would’ve had no children.” “He…uh…liked prostitutes and…”    At this point Mr. Demar raises his hand to you. You instantly feel yourself paralyzed. You can only watch helplessly as he stands up from his desk.  “Stop. While this is amusing watching you squirm, I am a busy man. You want to know what I think? I think you recently stole those books from Big Red. I also think you recently killed three of my students in a certain warehouse in your attempts to gain more. While I might’ve considered you as Dark Order material if you’d come in here and told me the truth, I can’t abide by liars, especially someone so poor at it. Such a pity.”  With those final words, Mr. Demar causes your heart to explode."
7397,65,"You’ve been doing pretty well by yourself so far, so you decide to continue that trend. Still you do wonder what Mr. Demar’s Dark Order is up to.  During the night you head out of the city and into the nearby wilderness. After checking around, you’re sure nobody else is around and you begin to cast your spell.  Soon it happens. You’ve summoned several ghostly figures to your side. The strain to control them is much greater, but you manage. However you don’t want to push your luck so after a few brief commands you dismiss them. You’ve satisfied your desires for awhile.   Another month passes and you go about your life more or less. Soon classes will start again, but you have no idea what you’re going to take. How can you? You’re sitting on all this forbidden knowledge that you seem to be extremely good at while the “acceptable” magic is stuff you can’t perform worth shit. Doesn’t seem fair somehow. Still you’re going to have to at least put up a front of normalcy if you’re going to not arouse suspicion.  You’re convinced you were born in the wrong time period. You should’ve been alive during the time of the Great Lich Lord. Ah how exciting those times must’ve been!  But as you soon find out, today’s times can be just as exciting…  As the first week of classes start rolling around you finally decide on taking something easy and head towards the registrar offices as a late arrival. As soon as you step out of your apartment building, you hear screams, sounds of battle, explosions and general sounds of chaos.  Portals are opening up all over the city and demons are pouring out of them! Amidst the bedlam you notice a few young wizards directing the demons. Demonologists. They have to be part of the Dark Order and this has to be some kind of plan of their to take over the city. You wished you’d joined up with them after all, but you think perhaps it might not be too late to get in on the action.  You’re about to do so, when you feel your whole body going in slow motion. Apparently you’re not the only one, but it doesn’t seem to be affecting the demons or Dark Order members. They must have someone also dabbling in temporal magic (A practically forgotten branch of magic which is also illegal, and obviously for good reason!)  It would seem that The Dark Order certainly has their shit together as far as this attack is concerned.  You’re not going to be deterred, but you know you need to be cautious. You slink back into your apartment building and back into your room. Remembering your spirit summoning from last month, you decide to try it again. You need defenders and ghosts are probably going to serve you better for as long as this slow spell lasts.  Once again you succeed and with your ghostly bodyguards you march outside a little more confident.  You find that the city is one big killing zone. Demons are really running amok through the streets, a few of them attack you, but your ghost protect you. It would appear that they don’t see you as an ally.  Sensing the need for even more protection, you raise some of the many dead bodies that now litter the streets. A few of Nuro’s mage guards attempt to stop you, but you easily defeat them and add them to your ranks. It’s so easy for you. Soon you’re commanding a small army and it’s barely taking any effort from you at all.  “HEY! Who the hell are you? You’re not in the Dark Order!” a voice calls out to you, and you turn around to see another necromancer. He’s rather non-descript looking and isn’t controlling nearly as many dead as you are. No ghosts either.  “I’m not. I’m what you call…independent I suppose.” “Oh is that right eh? Well if you ain’t with the Dark Order, you’re against us!”  You attempt to ask if you can come to some sort of arrangement, but he’s not hearing it, he orders his horde to attack you.  So much for making allies…  He and his troops are going to be faster, even if you do outnumber him, so you decide to do something else.  You enforce your will upon his advancing horde, and with a little effort you’re successful. They stop in their tracks, and then they turn around in his direction.  “Hey! Stop that! You can’t do that! You’re supposed to listen to me!” he shouts totally losing his cool, not to mention his control.  Instead of trying to regain it, he attempts to blast you with a bolt of negative energy, but at this point you’re well protected by meat shield of corpses, who seem to be moving faster…  The slow spell! It’s gone! Or at least it’s not affecting you anymore. You smile wickedly at the enemy necromancer. Now you can show him real power! He doesn’t get a few inches from his position before he’s overwhelmed and killed by your forces.  Besides the effects of the slow spell being gone, you also notice many of the demons jumping over the city walls, or otherwise leaving Nuro. You hear demonologists shouting at them to come back and once again you shake your head. It would appear that Mr. Demar and the Dark Order didn’t have their shit as together as you thought.  “Pah! This is what Mr. Demar had to work with? I guess I was lucky not to have hooked up with such fools!” you say to a nearby zombie who doesn’t answer.  You march through the city truly exercising your power for the first time, soon you come across two more necromancers attempting to destroy city hall where the last bastion of resistance resides in the city. An ugly man and a woman. Naturally it’s the ugly guy who calls over to you.  “Hey Irwin glad you…hey you’re not Irwin! Who are you?” “I’m the guy who can probably save your ass from this fiasco you Dark Orderites call a take over.” “Huh and I suppose YOU could’ve done a better job?” the woman sneers. “Better job than you’re doing. Look at you, you lost your demonic support and you can’t even take out the first citizen and his weak ass mage guards.” You retort. “Hey Catalina stop fighting! We got enough problems!” he says to the woman before addressing you. “Look, my name’s Sebastian and if you want to help out I’m not going to turn you away because you’re right, we could use it! I’m sure Mr. Demar is having no problems taking care of the dean and the other professors, but I’m more concerned with Quayle!” “Who’s that?” “He’s the guy that was responsible for that slow spell you were probably feeling the effects of earlier. I don’t what’s gone wrong with the spell, but some demonologist came by here a minute ago saying that the whole east side of campus is fucked up. Like it’s phasing in and out of existence or something. Someone needs to go check it out or stop it before we’re all killed!”"
7397,66,"While these Dark Orderites haven’t completely impressed you, you remember that Serena mentioned you would need allies and they could serve that purpose. From what you can tell, you’re a better necromancer than the rest of them and this city would be an excellent beginning of your career especially since you don’t have any better ideas in mind. You know that even if this event plays out well for you, you’re going to have a whole shit load of trouble ahead of you so you better get a few people on your side now even if they need to be “disposed” of later…  “Alright, I’ll help out, but I’m not doing this for you or following your orders, I have my own agenda!” you say flat out to Sebastian.  Before you leave Catalina speaks to you.  “So, come a long way from Enchantment class huh?” she says. “…I thought I recognized you…and yeah I have. I finally found a branch of magic I’m really good at.” You say finally realizing who she is. “Just remember, as good as you are, you aren’t the best.” “We’ll see.” You retort and leave.  The march towards the university where on the west side of campus you see and hear explosions. That must be where Mr. Demar is. You wonder how you’ll have to deal with him after you take care of this Quayle problem.  When you get to the east campus, Sebastian was right, you see a lot of weird things going on, nearby plants are growing older and younger before your eyes, buildings are indeed disappearing and reappearing. It’s a mess.  You see a small gray building that doesn’t seem to be suffering any effects; you bet that’s where Quayle is.  You march over with your horde only to start feeling very ill. You try to shake off the effects so you can keep control, but it doesn’t matter as you begin to see your various undead troops go through weird changes. You watch them either accelerate in rot and disintegrate, or even stranger actually turn back into their living selves until they eventually become babies and then nothing.  You’re only halfway to the building and you begin to worry that you’re going to suffer the same fate, but manage to get in the Gray building which contains a simple auditorium like classroom. You must be back on campus. At the front of the class you see a strange man surrounded by a white glow. This must be Quayle.  “This is not the way…you have lost…you may win…it’s all so fascinating…” he says in an echoed voice.  You have no idea what the hell he means, all you know is you need to kill this guy before he fucks everything up. You’re having a hard time concentrating still though and once again you begin to feel very sick. That feeling becomes stronger when you see grotesque creatures pop into existence. They have writhing masses of tentacles and give off an aura completely hostile and alien. Not even the demons you’ve had contact with give off anything like this.  You have no time for spells you’ll have to do this the old fashioned way. You run towards the front of the class where he sits and just narrowly dodge another tentacle beast appearing suddenly in front of you.  “…stop…stop it…you must stop…”  You tackle Quayle and something completely unexpected and disgusting happens. His body literally breaks like a fragile glass vase and all manner of insects and maggots come crawling out, mostly on you.  “EEEEYEEECAAAGH!” you yell trying to get them all off of you, completely ignoring anything else. Fortunately for you, whatever you did has stopped the temporal disturbance. The creatures disappear and everything else seems to go back to normal.  After stomping on some centipedes you notice Quayle’s head has rolled into a corner. Surprisingly it’s still alive.  “You have won nothing…” his head says before it just simply disappears.  You shake your own head at all of this. As much as you’ve seen during your short time raising the dead, you’ve never seen anything like this.  You can’t hear anymore explosions; you wonder if Mr. Demar has won. You exit the building and begin to walk over to the other side of the campus where the explosions were coming from.  You arrive to burning buildings and ruins of towers. Once again you see Sebastian, he’s sitting outside holding his head in his hands. He looks like he’s sobbing.  “What the hell is wrong with you?” you ask. “It’s over! It’s all over!” “What are you talking about? It looks like the city is ours.” “But for how long? All our so called demon allies took off! By the time I got here Mr. Demar had already been severely wounded and his second in command Trelik had betrayed him. Catalina and I managed to kill Trelik, but Catalina fell in the battle! The Dark Order is over and I dunno what’s coming next, we’re all in a lot of fucking trouble! Trouble that I wasn’t prepared to handle! I’m not really a leader. Mr. Demar was a leader! Oh man why did I choose this path!?”  Sebastian is having a complete mental break down and it sickens you. It’s unbecoming of a necromancer.  “Where’s Mr. Demar?” you ask. “He’s dead in the library!” “Good, saves me the trouble.” “Huh? What’s going on?” “I’m in charge, that’s what’s going on and I’m not going to tolerate whimpering weaklings like you.” and you blast Sebastian with negative energy to his face, killing him.  Yep, you’re in charge.    A month passes  The “Nuro Incident” as it came to be known was a shock to the civilized world. Nobody had anticipated such a thing occurring despite all preparations. Certainly not to Nuro given it’s near “invincible” reputation. You’ve renamed the city Aftermath.  The Grand Alliance was immediately formed to retake the city, but fortunately for you, you weren’t the only problem they had.  Velzix, a demon lord who the Dark Order summoned to help them, soon left Nuro during its attack, and managed to unite the rest of the demons that felt the need to break their contract with the Dark Order. They turned their attention to the Tulan Kingdom. Right now he’s established his own rule, enslaving the population and is most likely planning further conquest assuming he can keep his own troops from fighting each other long enough.  As for you, you’ve already managed to hold off one Grand Alliance attack quite successfully due to your preparations. The first thing you did was command all the surviving Dark Order members to become necromancers. They’re mediocre at best though, they might be better if you took a more direct hand in training them, but you’re too impatient and you have so many other things to take care of as well.  You haven’t heard anything from your family; you can only wonder what they think of all this and you don’t really care.  While things are somewhat quiet now, that’s not going to last. The Grand Alliance will keep attacking and they may very well overwhelm you in time. You can’t just sit in your throne room and prepare for the next attack and you need to be proactive about this threat, but the big problem though is, you’re basically doing all of this yourself. There isn’t anyone anywhere near your equal, let alone anyone you can trust to handle important things.  As much as you loathe thinking of it, you could ally with Velzix, granted he’s an untrustworthy demon, and not fond of the Dark Order for imprisoning him, you were never a member of the Dark Order and may be receptive. You soon send messages to him asking for an alliance. Eventually you get a response, and it’s a positive one. Velzix even says he’ll meet you in the city of Aftermath. Apparently he isn’t worried about you.  When he arrives he gets right to business. “Nice decorations…so, you wish to make a deal with me?” “I’ve come to propose a pact between us yes. We have a common enemy.” “Yes, but what does this pact entail exactly?” “Simple, we don’t attack one another and we coordinate our attacks to be more effective against the Grand Alliance.” “And I suppose while my attention isn’t on you, and I waste my valuable resources, you build up strength and attack me eh? Heh heh, I know you little necromancer. I see the desire to murder the entire world in your eyes. I even respect it, but if you think I’m trusting you, you’re as brain dead as those corpses you raise.” “What?! You’re a fucking demon and you’re accusing ME of being deceitful?” “Of course. Who better to see treachery than one who is an expert at it? But assuming you genuinely mean for us to be best buddies forever and ever, I still don’t see what you can do for me in your current state.” “What are you on about now?” “I’m saying as a military power you ain’t shit that’s what! Your necromancers are barely competent enough to hold your defenses of that little necropolis you rule. It’s mostly you doing all the work, and while you’ve got a little power, it still ain’t enough to attack anything in a meaningful way.”  You hate the fact that Velzix is right, but you hate it even more that he’s so damn smug about it. Which makes you wonder why he called you out here…in fact you’re starting to prepare yourself for trouble.  “Alright then what the hell are you proposing?” you ask. “I propose a…merger rather than an alliance.” “You’re proposing that I let YOU take over Aftermath and I just become your bitch.” “Not exactly how I worded it, but if you prefer that designation…” ”NO! I don’t prefer it!” “Okay then how about this? I say you’ll last maybe another year tops if you stay walled up in this little city of yours just letting the Grand Alliance constantly beat down your gates until they finally succeed. Then assuming you don’t die during that final attack, I predict that you live a ragged existence on the run for maybe a couple years afterwards at which point you’ll end up getting hunted down and killed hiding in some cave somewhere.” “And that’s what you see?” “Seen it happen to more powerful mortals than you. BUT! It doesn’t have to be that way. Joining with me can be more beneficial than you think. You don’t think I don’t see the power in you? You would be a very valuable asset to my plans. Your ability to control the dead is very strong and quite frankly it would be nice to actually have not just troops that aren’t fighting among themselves, but a great general as well. Think about it! You’ll gain more power and you could still bring death to thousands and not have to worry about all the bullshit of ruling, because as I’m sure you know, it isn’t as fun as it should be most of the time. You will prosper, if you continue to prove yourself worthy and useful.”"
7397,67,"Velzix’s offer does have some appeal to it, you must admit, but having to answer to Velzix is repugnant to you. You feel that you were meant to rule, not follow. Perhaps you can build up a following though while serving under his rule, there’s nothing saying you HAVE to be loyal…  “Very well. I’ll join you.”  Velzix smiles.  “Ha ha! I knew you’d see the smart thing to do little necromancer. I predict this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship…”  You transfer your city over to Velzix, though the majority of your undead are still there, he just supplements its defenses with some of his own demons and the humans that have pledged their servitude to him."
7397,68,"  Chapter 3: One Foot in Hell    One year has passed…  It’s been one year since you made an alliance with Velzix, and so far it has paid off. With your combined might, you both have successfully held off the Grand Alliance. You haven’t gained too much ground, but that’s looking like it’s about to change.  Everyday Velzix has somehow been managing to attract “free demons” from other nations to join him, though its not as if they have too many other options as mere suspicion has turned into hatred and they are to be rounded up and killed as possible enemies. Though again, thanks to mortal failings and greed, there are those few nations that are still letting their small demonic populations run free. Not surprisingly Velzix has been attempting to convince the leaders of these governments into joining him in exchange for even greater power. Velzix has also been attempting to open portals to his own infernal realm on a permanent basis. Right now he can summon in a few reinforcements to replace battle losses, but nothing on a major scale.  As for you, things could be worse, but they could be better. All your potential “acolytes” reverted back to being demonologist when the merge came, though many of them were purged by Velzix himself, as he still remembered their attempts to imprison him before during their days in the Dark Order, not to mention if they were so quick to change allegiances so quickly, then they obviously weren’t to be trusted.  Your magic powers in other branches of magic have somewhat improved, though this might be due your infernal dealings. Necromancy is still your area of expertise obviously and as it stands, you’re the only true necromancer allied with Velzix. You sort of hold a unique position, but you question its importance in the scheme of things. You’ve been basically put on defense duty. Your undead troops are nothing more than meat shields for the most part, and while that is what they are there for, you’d rather they be YOUR meat shields than some asshole demons, (or worse mortals). You feel like your talents are being wasted to a degree, like you’ve got a lot of untapped potential that’s dying to get out.  However, open rebellion against Velzix isn’t likely to happen, but there’s nothing stopping you from setting the stage. You still have Aftermath under your control, even if you do have to put up with the demons and mortals stationed there now. One night in your study while you’re contemplating how to go about all this, you figure there are two ways.  You’ve actually got a lot of troops at your immediate disposal. You believe you could probably take over the nearby Brot Kingdom by yourself without any help. They have a weak military and most of the Grand Alliance armies are busy elsewhere. You could build up a bigger power base. You might piss off Velzix by doing this by yourself, but you could take the chance that he might over look it if you’re successful as it’s also increasing his own territory.  The other option is to remain doing what you’re doing and engage in a more secret assassination conspiracy against Velzix. You already know that tons of others are probably doing it, why not you? The problem is, individually most of you are fairly weak against him; though together you’d be more successful. Of course getting a bunch of demonic assassinating liars to trust one another is probably even more difficult than the attempt itself."
7397,69,"What’s the point of having power, if you aren’t using it in any meaningful way that can help you? You’re sick of being “reined in”. You’re going to do what you’ve been wanting to do for a long time.  You prepare to march an army of undead to the Brot Kingdom. The demons and mortals stationed at Aftermath are wondering what’s going on though since most of them know you’re mainly used for defense.  “Where do you think yer goin’?” a demon solder steps up to ask you as you’re about to leave the city gates. “I’m gonna go conquer the Brot Kingdom, got a problem with that?” “Me? No, not at all. Just didn’t know Velzix let you off your leash.” The demon soldier grins.  This remark is met with a negative energy blast to his face, completely ripping the flesh off and revealing the still grinning skull underneath. As the rest of this body falls to the ground, you feel the need to make a speech to the gawking onlookers.  “I am not on anyone’s fucking leash! Nobody tells me what the do! Now what’s going to happen, is I’m going to leave and lay waste to the Brot Kingdom. The rest of you are going to defend this place while I’m gone! And when Velzix comes here, like I know he will I’LL handle it. The rest of you can cower before that fucker, but I ain’t the one.”  Having made your thoughts known, you return to your undead army, which obediently still stands only awaiting your commands. As the way things should be. The way ALL things should be.  After a few days you eventually reach the Brot Kingdom. You start by decimating the small border villages and then quickly raising the peasants you slaughtered. You’ve moved on to larger towns before the Brot military manages to start opposing you. Their military is weak though. Most of them see your horde and run in terror before the fight even begins! Those are the smart ones. The rest soon become just more fodder for you to raise. You actually feel more powerful after your conquests, which is odd given the amount of energy you’ve been expending. You can only take this as a sign of this being what you were meant for!  Within the week you’ve single handedly taken control of the Brot capitol and most of the Kingdom in general. Much of the royal family has abased themselves before you in an attempt for you to spare their lives. You laugh and grant this request, after all someone has to still run this territory. You’ve successfully subjugated your first territory. In fact, it’s the first “real” territory conquered since Velzix took over the Tulan Kingdom. Tivadol’s petty victories haven’t even compared to what you’ve done.  When you return to Aftermath, you’re half expecting to be met by Velzix, who has undoubtedly heard of your actions by now. It’s only now that you realize you may be in more trouble than you thought! However, you’re surprisingly met by Sesisek instead who sits in your study.  “This place is as dead as my status among demonkind.” He says looking at the many skeletal structures and decorations.  “It’s a fucking necropolis, I’m a necromancer, and what do you want? I figured Velzix would be here meeting me.” “Oh he’s on his way, and from what I’ve heard, he’s quite pissed about you playing the role of conqueror. He’s just a little more preoccupied with the Grand Alliance army that’s currently attacking him directly right now, which probably explains why you met little resistance at Brot. Congratulations on your victory, I’m sure Tivadol won’t be too pleased with accomplishing something he couldn’t either.” “Yeah, yeah, so why are you here?” “I’m here to help you get out of this shit pit you’ve stepped in and are quickly in danger of sinking further into. You’ve showed entirely too much ambition, too soon, my mortal friend.” “What of it? Like I’m the only one plotting against Velzix? Hah! Tivadol makes no pretense of his goals.” “Ah yes, but you’re not taking some things into consideration. Tivadol is still a demon and you my mortal friend are not. We are not fond of ever being bested, but to be bested by a mortal is even more repugnant to us. Tivadol is also a predictable loud mouth brute who is never going to achieve his goal. Velzix knows exactly how to manipulate him. Perhaps the day will come where he’ll have to kill him, but that day is far off in the future. You on the other hand are still new and he’s still learning about you. Velzix probably thought you could be manipulated and cowed into submission by his sheer strength and magic abilities alone, but it’s apparent that you aren’t afraid of such things. I could’ve seen that though. Necromancers embrace death; fear of it won’t be a factor. Though there are worse things than death…” “Guess you’re proof of that.” You mock. “Hmm, your pointless barbs at me are quite unproductive and are in fact hindering you. I am offering to help you, I’d advise that you take it before you meet Velzix.” “Offering me help huh? I seriously doubt you’re doing this out of kindness.” “Of course not. I’m doing it because I see an opportunity for revenge and quite frankly, you are the only one that will be able to help me achieve it. However, I assure you that we will both profit greatly from this, if you listen to me. If you don’t want my help though, I shall leave.”  “Okay I’m listening, what are you suggesting?” “Ha ha, no my mortal friend. I would be quite the fool if I told you how to handle Velzix before I got your word that you are in fact accepting my help. ARE you accepting my help?”  Sesisek looks at you expectantly."
7397,70,"Well, you probably could use the help in this matter. Smoothing this out with Velzix is going to be a delicate affair.  “Alright, I’m accepting your help.” “Excellent.” Sesisek smiles.  Sesisek explains that even if you do manage to talk Velzix into not killing you for your actions, he’s still going to take away your hard earned victory for himself. You can’t let him do this, nor are you to get into a fight with him. Instead you must convince Velzix that you are indeed loyal and would never dream of betraying him, but that you must take a more active role in things if you are to be effective. You must remind him that if you’re doing activity, then Velzix can concentrate more on opening up the portal to back home and victory will come quicker. Finally you must always point out of how weak you are compared to the might of Velzix, remind him that you are but a lowly mortal and will always remain so when compared to a demon lord.  After advising you, Sesisek leaves you as he mentions he doesn’t want to be around if things don’t go well. He doesn’t need anymore of Velzix’s anger to spread out to him, but if you happen to be successful; he’ll definitely be around to provide more help in the future  You feel just by agreeing to this you’ve lost something of yourself. Much like when you allied with Velzix. Maybe you haven’t gone so far to sell your soul and granted you were walking the path of darkness to begin with, but the twisted taint of hell that you’ve been getting deeper into is definitely starting to change you and it’s probably not for the better.  In any case a couple days pass and Velzix arrives, he’s a little more calm than you were expecting, but he could blow up at any minute.  “So little necromancer, I hear you have been taking matters into your own hands and acquiring territory yourself. I am displeased that you have done this. The Grand Alliance has been attacking and you’ve been squandering my potential reinforcements elsewhere. What if they had succeeded in breaking through my defenses? I would’ve had no troops to support my position, and much would’ve been lost.” “Forgive me, but I felt that with the Grand Alliance focusing their attention elsewhere, I believed an attack on the Brot Kingdom would be a good idea. And I might add, it was. The conquest was very successful.” “Yes, but you have dodged the question of what would’ve happened had the Grand Alliance broke through my defenses?” “I did not worry about such a thing since I knew they would be no match for a powerful demon lord such as yourself and even if they had, I’m sure you personally could’ve dealt with the few stragglers. They are only mortals after all; they would never be a match for you.” “Obsequious words little necromancer…I have never heard any such tone from you before. You have always carried an air of arrogance about you. Tell me, is my mere presence enough to make you regret your clumsy attempts at gaining more power?” “I fear you have misjudged me in this. I simply feel that my talents have not been used to their full degree, because you believe I shall be treacherous in the future. I have no desire to do such a thing. What would be the point? I could never hope to defeat you anyway. I only wish to be more active in your eventual conquest of this world. I have already proven to be a more competent general than Tivadol.”  Velzix laughs out loud at this last statement.  “I’m sure Tivadol will be thrilled to hear that a mortal has achieved more in military victories on this world than he has…very well. You wish to choose a more active role, so be it. It will be most amusing to see Tivadol compete with you, perhaps this will even inspire him to succeed, since as you have pointed out, he has yet to conquer an entire kingdom for me like you have…and it IS MY kingdom is it not?” “Yes, it is.” You say with a bow. “Hmm, yes. Well you’ve talked your way out of this one necromancer, but know that I will still be watching you. You had best prove successful in your new active role, but also remember who is in charge and who serves.” “Of course.”  Velzix informs you that since you have taken on this role, he’ll be issuing more orders to you AND that it will be up to you to oversee larger areas of territory (Starting with the recently acquired Brot Kingdom), not just Aftermath. And if you fuck up, you’re going to get fucked up.  And with that, you have your new place in the hierarchy…  Four years pass…  It’s been five years since you made your alliance with Velzix, so far it’s proven most beneficial more or less.  You’ve managed to carve out a niche for yourself as a good general, and just in time too since Velzix has been successful in keeping infernal portals open longer which is allowing more demons to come in. While your undead troops are looking to be somewhat “obsolete” your expertise in military planning has assured you a place in this demonic empire.  You don’t lead demons though of course. They’d never allow such a thing. You lead a strange combination of undead and mortals who have decided to throw their lot in with the infernal forces. Sesisek has even provided you with a few mortals who have displayed an interest in necromancy, allowing you to not carry the weight of up keeping an undead army constantly anymore. While you haven’t completely abandoned your necromantic roots, you’ve been forced to broaden your magical horizons and tap into the infernal plane, which has allowed you to create potent unnatural abominations.  However, this type of magic is highly experimental and you’re probably the first one to even attempt it. It’s beginning to take a toll on your deteriorating health, because as they say, you don’t change hell, hell changes you. However your power is keeping you going. You haven’t lost sight that one day you’ll be in charge…  Your immediate rivals haven’t lost sight either, in fact you’ve become more of a threat. Tivadol the Destroyer constantly makes threats that he’ll one day see you crushed underneath his foot. Sinthinia is a little more interested in your relationship with Sesisek and finds the fact that you two are on too good of terms to be very suspicious. Oddly Velzix doesn’t seem worried about this though, or if he is, he hasn’t made it known to you. Indeed he’s been pre-occupied lately with finally opening up a portal permanently to his infernal home. He believes he will soon be successful.  In the meantime, the Grand Alliance has been hard pressed to hold the line, they are slowly losing ground to you and Tivadol. Heroes from all over the civilized governments have been employed, but so far they’ve have proven unsuccessful in even getting to Velzix, let alone killing him. Vampire assassins however have had a little more luck, but Sinithina’s internal security magic guards have detected them all as soon as they get near Velzix’s fortress.  You can’t say you’re too thrilled yourself with Velzix opening up a permanent portal as it could certainly make your job a lot harder of killing him in the future. Sesisek, realizes this too and has recently approached you about this.  He tells you to meet him for a plan to kill Velzix, in a couple days. While you’re in your study pondering what this could entail, you are suddenly “greeted” with Sinthinia’s presence. Unusual since she’s directly kept her distance from you ever since you conquered the Brot Kingdom. (Indirectly through her spies is another matter however) Whatever she has come to see you for probably isn’t good…or is it?   “Hmm, this place still reeks of death I see. It is much too cold in this place. Not warm like many of our other conquests. Look how hard my nipples are. Why it’s cold enough to make me almost want to put on clothes…almost.” She says touching herself in a seductive way. You’ve seen her in action before, and you’re not some weak willed fool, so this routine has little effect on you. “Yeah, well zombies tend to be flammable and I hate the heat, so this grave chill stays. You’ll just have to deal with hard nipples.” “How about YOU deal with them. Hm?” “Sinthinia what do you want?” “Besides your dick in my nice warm body? I want to see you not ruin your most promising career by siding with a loser like Sesisek. I know that the two of you have been collusion together ever since you conquered the Brot Kingdom…a most bold move might I add. Only the first of many. You are obviously a man who knows what he wants and takes it…”  At this point Sinthinia is turning on her demonic seduction and getting closer to the point of touching you. You’d be lying if it wasn’t having any effect on you.  “Yeah…well just get the point Sinthinia!” “See? So forceful! Very well, the point. My point is Sesisek is an obsessed fool who’s time is running out. I know he’s got plans to kill me and Velzix, so far I haven’t exactly determined how he’s going to attempt it, but I know it’s coming soon. My concern is, if YOU have anything to do with such plans. It would be a shame if you did…” “Well he hasn’t said anything to me about any specific plan.” You reply. “Ah, careful words you chose without actually lying. You have been hanging around our kind and learning! However you will not dodge me so easily. Specific plan. Specific being the key word. I’m guessing he’s approached you about some act of treachery though and just hasn’t given you the details yet.”  You say nothing and she presses up against you while speaking into your ear so close that she nibbles on it a bit.  “I’ll take your silence as a yes. Know however that you are still not powerful enough to kill Velzix. I am very close to him just like I am very close to you right now and I can tell you with all certainty that you will not be able to defeat him. Not even with that bitter old idiot Sesisek helping you…I advise that you not go down the same path as he is.” “Oh yeah? Well if you think we’re doing something, why not just kill us both right now?” “It’s not how I work my necromantic cutie. Besides, I am giving you a chance to join with a better and more grateful ally in the long run. Namely me. I want you to find out what Sesisek’s plan is and then at the right time, betray him. I would be most grateful.” “Hmm, I don’t trust you. Sesisek trusted you once and look what happened.” “Sesisek proved to be weak and unworthy of my loyalty, but of course you don’t trust me, nor should you. Still, you think on this, I have offered to become your ally and more if you wish. I run the internal security of Velzix’s empire. Do you not think that having me as an ally would be more beneficial for your future than to stay allied with Sesisek whose plan is surely doomed to failure? I already KNOW he’s planning something. He will be punished soon, along with all that have conspired with him. Stay loyal to him and you’ll suffer his fate. Betray him, and you’ll suddenly find yourself in control of his holdings and have one less potential enemy to worry about. Not to mention you will make me very happy. So happy that I may provide favors for you that you could never dream of. So what do you say?”  Normally you’d think more about it, but Sinthinia has made a somewhat appealing offer and the fact that she’s currently shoved one of her hands down your pants and stroking your cock isn’t exactly helping you think straight either."
7397,71,"If Sinthinia already knows that something is going on, chances are she’s already got counter measures to solve it. Her overtures for an alliance, must be some what genuine to some degree otherwise she’d just let you go through with this plan and just have you all killed when you attempt it.  “Okay, Sinthinia I’m in.” you say.  Sinthinia continues to rub against you and then looks into your eyes before kissing you.  “Mmmm, I can taste the truthfulness on your lips. A rare flavor around here. I’m glad you decided to join me; we’re going to have so much fun together. Now, let me taste more of you. Something more…carnal.”  A few hours later Sinthinia leaves your study (Which is now a mess) and remarks that she’ll be expecting to see you soon after you meet with Sesisek.  A few days pass and you meet Sesisek in the forsaken area known as the Drozz Wasteland. The barbarian tribes here still hold sway, but you need not concern yourself with such minor threats, they know enough to stay away from two dark individuals such as yourselves, and the others…  The others in question are vampires. It would appear that Sesisek has been planning more than just “normal” betrayal. The vampires eye you warily.  “So, how did you swing a deal with the vampire clans?” you ask. “Let’s just say we all have similar interests. And that interest is seeing Velzix die and that bitch Sinthinia.” “Remember Sesisek, our primary target is Velzix! Your desire for revenge on other targets is secondary!” one the vampires exclaims. “And I assure you that taking out Sinthinia is very necessary to our goals as well. She’s head of internal security. Killing her is vital to our plan.” “I thought getting Mr. Necromancer here to mask us long enough to enter Veltrix’s fortress was the plan?” “He will be, but…” “Hey hold on, what am I supposed to be doing now?” you interrupt while exaggerating your clueless act. “You mean you haven’t even informed him yet or what’s going on?” “I was going to do it now!” Sesisek hisses before turning to you. “Look isn’t it true that you can use some sort of necromantic magic to hide our friends here? The reason why assassination attempts have been so unsuccessful before is thanks to all the magic detection security in the fortress.” “Oh. I see what you’re getting at. Yeah, but I can’t just do it myself. I’d still be giving off too much of a deathly aura that would probably arouse suspicion from Sinthinia’s detection shit. I’d have to enter the fortress with either a bunch of zombies and skeletons, or I suppose I could just enter with a few of my abominations. Those would arouse less suspicion since I use them as bodyguards anyway. You vampires could travel with us invisibly, and you shouldn’t be detected until you decide to go into a blood frenzy and start killing everyone.” “Ha ha! See! I told you he could do it.”  You all “agree” to this plan and hammer out some other details before parting ways.  You head back to Aftermath, when your undead abomination bodyguards begin to sniff the air and you feel a presence stalking you, you stop and prepare yourself for an attack. Once again the vampire assassins become visible. Apparently they’ve been following you.  “You can’t sneak up on a necromancer. I can sense your undead presence remember blood leech?” “Is that what you still consider yourself? I thought you’d become a worshipper of demons rather than death, given how long you’ve been with them.” One of the assassins says. “No. I don’t worship anything. I’m concerned with my own power; all of this is just a means to an end. And I have not given up the necromantic arts; you would be wise to remember that vampire.” “Good. Then it’s not too late.” “What are you on about?” “Look, this plan will be more successful if you fully cooperate with us. After we kill Velzix, Lord Rostov wants to invite you to join us. He feels that your connection and understanding of death along with your power would serve the Clans well. Among us, you would find a sort of peace. You would not have to deal with demons anymore.” “You must be joking! After I kill Velzix, I’m taking over! And anyone who opposes me is going to feel my wrath!” you say still keeping up the illusion that you’re going through with this assassination.  The vampire assassin runs her fingers through her hair and pauses before speaking again.   “No you won’t. And I’m not talking about a knife in your back by one of us either. I’m saying if you believe you’ll be able to control an empire mixed with mortals, demons AND while controlling all your undead troops, then you’re beyond delusional. Look at you. You’re a wreck from all the infernal magic you’ve been taping into. Is it any wonder that demonologists don’t live a long time? It’s probably only due to your baffling plentiful necromantic energy that’s kept you going this long. Even if you do manage to rein in the chaotic nature of the demons, and hold off the Grand Alliance, I doubt you’ll live enough to enjoy any of it, let alone conquer anymore territory.” “I guess you bloodsuckers forgot that I can always become a lich.” “A lich? There hasn’t been one of those since the time of the Great Lich Lord! The amount of death energy to become one must be huge! You’re not there yet, you’re not likely to get there and you’re not pure enough anyway. You’re tainted too much by hell. While you haven’t directly sold your soul, you’ve thrown your lot in with them long enough to be damned. You will not be allowed to escape death on your own. BUT…becoming one of us will give you a chance. You will defeat death, and live lifetimes.”  You think on the assassin’s words. Much of what she says is true. You aren’t in the best condition anymore. You’re in pain a lot though you try to ignore it and not display your weakness. As far as being damned, you’re not sure, but it’s probably true. Your thoughts have focused less on death and more on demonic nightmares. The purity of what you once pursued HAS been tainted. You could almost kick yourself for allowing yourself to turn into what you are.  However, you wonder if the vampire is just telling you this to get you on their side. They must be worried about you if they want you to join this bad. Of course he could just be lying, but you don’t think so. After being around so many liars you’ve come to see the signs, not to mention your own insights into the undead."
7397,72,"You’ve come to the realization that the assassin is correct. You foresee a long struggle plagued by headache after headache if you continue to deal with these demons. It’s been nothing, but back stabbing and double dealing since you’ve dealt with them. Given your recent “alliance” with Sinthinia, you can only expect more of the same from her. Is that what you really want to deal with? Not to mention if Velzix DOES open the portal to his infernal realm he’ll be even more powerful and no matter what you do, you can’t stand against hell alone and the demons would NEVER follow the likes of you.  Joining the vampire clans might not be ideal, but then again nothing you’ve done so far has.  “Alright, I’ll join.” “Excellent. Though I certainly hope you’re being sincere. It would be such a shame if you lying…” “No I mean it. My days of walking with demons are going to be at an end soon. One way or another.”  Coming to an agreement, you prepare yourself for this assassination attempt. You also plan to have all your undead troops strike at just the right time to cause even more chaos since you won’t be sticking around after Velzix’s death. At least you hope you won’t.  A few days pass and Sesisek tells you that he has everything ready. He mentions he’ll be taking care of Sinthinia personally along with her whole secret service. You’ll meet the vampire assassins in a dead forest near Fury.  You send Sinthinia a message that you’ll be arriving at Fury to report what Sesisek is planning. She’ll be expecting you, but what will actually happen, will be completely different.  You make your trek to Fury, without incident with your hidden friends in tow. You take a deep breath before entering the gates where upon you half expect the demon guards to stop you, but nothing happens. You’ve succeeded. Your next move is to get as quickly as possible to Velzix’s inner chambers.  You don’t get far when an alarm is raised…  “Assassins! Kill them! Sinthinia’s orders!” one of the demon guards says. Suddenly you’re surrounded on all sides  Shit, apparently Sinthinia was somewhat wise to your last act of treachery.  You mentally call out to your undead minions to attack anything living.  “Come on! Secrecy is over! We gotta haul ass to Velzix!” you exclaim.  While chaos is reigning in the fortress, you and the vampires easily dispatch those that would attempt to stop you. When you get to Velzix’s inner chambers where he’s attempting to open up a portal to get reinforcements.  “Treachery. I expected this from Sesisek, but I am very disappointed in you. I had such plans…oh well perhaps I will yet get pleasure when I break your bones and have you flayed over the course of a very long and painful torture period. And I assure you, you’ll be very much alive to experience it.”  Velzix’s portal opens and a swarm of demons come pouring out. The vampire assassins waste no time and begin their work with deadly efficiency. Your abominations have less finesse, but they get the job done.  Velzix unleashes horrible infernal magic that causes a couple of the assassins to liquefy. You’re just trying to stay out of the way of most of the fighting and attempting to keep a control over your troops, but you soon realize you’re going to have to play a direct role in his death and unleash your own negative energy bolts at Velzix.  The battle is brutal, and dead bodies soon litter the chamber. You’re beginning to feel the effects of the energy you’ve expended in this fight. Thankfully Sesisek arrives with some of his mortal lackeys, giving you a breather. He looks like he’s seen a hard battle already, but still has a lot of fight left due to the revenge that fuels his rage.  “Velzix! Your bitch is dead! Now you shall join her!” he shouts and unleashes a flurry of blades upon his former master.  In the mean time the femal vampire assassin that first approached you comes to help you up.  “Come on let’s get out of here.” “We haven’t killed Velzix yet.” “Yes we have, look.”  You look over at the battle between the two demons and its clear Sesisek has the upper hand, literally. He’s chopped off one of the Velzix’s limbs at the forearm. You take the assassin’s advice and leave with her.  After a little more fighting to get out of the Fortress, eventually you find refuge in the dead forest again. Chaos has overtaken Velzix’s realm. You doubt if his demonic empire will be able to recover from this, even if he manages to survive.  You’re so tired that you don’t have time to react when you’re suddenly bitten on the neck and drained of your blood.  You feel your life force ebb and then disappear completely…  You die and for a moment you can feel yourself being pulled towards the infernal realm and the hideous tortures that await you there, however you are sudden brought back to the living, so to speak within just a few minutes. You don’t feel the taint of hell within you anymore, but you also feel less powerful in terms of necromantic energy. You can sense that whatever undead troops you raised or controlled have now crumbled or collapsed.  “Good, you’re up. Welcome to your new life. Your blood tasted terrible. Ugh. All tainted and shit. Spat most of it out.” “Wow, I’m really one of you now.” You say ignoring her comment and still in awe of your new form.  “That’s right. But I think you’ll find that you won’t have some of your powers anymore. While this transition does have benefits, it has it’s downsides as well. But I’m sure Lord Rostov will still find you a welcome addition to the clans. I think he’s actually been interested in meeting and talking with you. Been awhile since we had someone new join us. We should go now, the sun will be up soon.”  The vampire assassin pulls out a black cube like device and presses a few button and you’re whisked away to the Vampire Clan secret fortress. It is there that you begin you new life.  In the years to come, the chaos caused by Velzix’s demonic empire settles down somewhat. Velzix did indeed die that day in battle with Sesisek, but he did not live long after getting his revenge. He was soon cut down by other demons who saw a grand opportunity to kill the hated traitor. The Grand Alliance once again gained the upper hand as the demonic infighting begins to take its toll. Tivadol the Destroyer who was the last remaining demon with any meaningful leadership skills was eventually struck down in battle by your sister who became a hero. Your parents also survive the chaos. This pleases you, well about your Mom and sister anyway.  As for you, once again you find yourself under orders, this time by Lord Rostov, but you don’t mind them. You find this life of ruling the mortal world through the shadows to be more appealing and less hassle. While it is true you no longer possess the powers you once had, and may never get them back, you’ve come to be satisfied with less and not living a life in constant pain anymore.  Your existence continues and the future is unknown as the world’s status quo is starting to return, but your life as a necromancer is over."
7397,73,"To side with these bloodsuckers would be folly. First of all they would not be asking for you to join them, if they didn’t feel you were a threat. This means you have the upper hand. Second of all, despite what they claim about your dealings with the infernal plane, you ARE still a necromancer, and as such it is not you who should be taking orders from the dead, it is THEY who should be taking orders from YOU! You’re confident that you’ll be able to “beat” Hell without losing yourself to it. The assassin did make you think somewhat on your future. You’re going to have to be twice as more intimidating than you are if you want to survive, and what you have in store is going to ensure such a thing.  “I shall have to think on it.” You say with a non-committal answer. “Yes, well you don’t have too much time to do so. I” The assassin says and leaves with her brethren.  You make your way back to Aftermath and then send a message to Sinthinia that you’ve got the entire plan. When you explain to her what exactly is going to happen, she’s positively having an orgasm at the thought of what she’s going to have done to Sesisek in her special torture chamber. Afterwards you begin to make plans of your own.  A few days pass and Sesisek tells you that he has everything ready. He mentions he’ll be taking care of Sinthinia personally along with her whole secret service. You’ll meet the vampire assassins in a dead forest near Fury.  You send Sinthinia a message that you’ll be arriving at Fury to report what Sesisek is planning. She’ll be expecting you, but what will actually happen, will be completely different.  When you meet the vampire assassins, you arrive in a “hurried and disheveled” state so that you look like you’ve been in an attack. They’re wondering what’s going on.  “They found out about the plan! Someone found out and told Sinthinia and Velzix! I barely survived an ambush! I’ve definitely made my decision, I’m joining you!” “And what makes you think our offer still stands?” the female assassin asks “Because I risked my life to even warn you guys about this! I could’ve just ran off and left you here waiting for the demon detachment that’s on its way now! You also still obviously need all the help you can get to defeat Velzix, and he’s only gotten closer to opening up his permanent portal. I still can be of use, I still have vital information that can hamper his goal, but we need to get out of here right now! Take me, or don’t, but you have nothing to lose by taking me with you, after all I am currently depleted and hopelessly out numbered by your kind.”  The female assassin turns to her fellow vampires and they converse a second before agreeing.  “Very well, we’ll take you. I hope for your sake you’ll have something of importance to tell Lord Rostov, or you’ll find yourself trading one death for another. And you will still have to prove yourself more before we’ll make you one of us.”  You nod, and contain your smile. The vampire assassin pulls out a black cube like device and presses a few button and you’re whisked away to the Vampire Clan secret fortress.  Now to put your plan into action…  Suddenly you greatly draw upon the hellish energy of the infernal realm and summon the very souls being tormented there to assist you. Stealing from hell like this is a very dangerous task and you feel very drained, but you manage to maintain your control.  The vampire assassins barely have time to react before the hellfire spirits set them on fire on the inside out as them attempt to enter their soulless shells, looking for a new “home”. The short lived screams of the vampires is one of extreme agony, proving that even the undead may feel pain.  “YES! Onward my tormented slaves! There are many corporeal shells for you to inhabit!”  You walk calmly through the Vampire Clan Fortress as the hellfire spirits slaughter the vampires with ease. The screams begin to grow on you. You may be a necromancer, but you think now you have a better understanding of what it means to be a demon. Your thoughts have become steadily more twisted with each passing blood leech death.  Finally you reach Lord Rostov. He looks very regal and dignified even when certain doom awaits him. He says nothing merely attempts to fend off your fiery minions. He does better than his underlings, but ultimately he too is burned to a crisp, putting an end to the vampire clans once and for all.  Now it’s just you alone with several of these burning souls still screaming for a host body. You’re barely keeping them from attacking you and you begin to dismiss them immediately, sending them back to hell. Except one. One which you have plans for and are going to take the ultimate gamble with.  Letting your guard down you release the spirit from your command which enters inside your body.  You’ve felt pain before as you’ve slowly aligned yourself with hell, but none of it has ever compared to this. Your whole inside of your body is literally on fire. You feel the organs in your body rise in temperature, and explode as they burn up. There is no way you should be surviving this, but something else within you has taken control.  Your will and your desire for one. Your unnatural ties to necromantic energy for another.  “NO! I will NOT die like this! YOU are MY servant and I am the master here! I will be master of ALL! You will obey me and cease this behavior instantly!” you bellow, as your vocal cords burn away making your “bellow” sound more like a terrible hissing raspy sound.  You collapse and continue burning and convulsing on the stone floor trying to fight off death and tame this disobedient spirit. After about a day of this, the transformation is complete.  What you are exactly is questionable however. Are you alive? Are you undead? Are you a demon? Perhaps you’re all three now.  The tormented hell spirit is still within what’s left of your burned body, though you’ve completely absorbed whatever “free will” it might’ve had. The pain is still there though somewhat duller. You probably shouldn’t be feeling anything given that all your nerves have been destroyed and technically being dead and all, but the powers of hell are known to extend pain even after death. You know it’s somehow keeping you alive, but at a heavy duty price obviously.  You get up wracked with pain all over your blackened and smoldering body. If you were a mess before, you’re a complete wreck now, but you’ve gained more power than you ever could’ve while as a mortal. And you’ve not only swindled death, but hell as well. You’ve achieved something even the Great Lich Lord didn’t do.  And if all goes as planned you’ll achieve ANOTHER thing he didn’t do.  But first you’ll go check on your new “ally” Sinthinia.  When you leave the Vampire Clan Fortress, you find that Velzix’s realm had to put down a very small rebellion. Sesisek seeing that his plan had gone to complete shit when you and the vampires didn’t arrive decided he was going to go ahead with it anyway. He and a few thousand foolish mortals that followed him attacked in open revolt. He didn’t last long before he was easily put down. You were actually thought to be dead (Which isn’t entirely inaccurate) while you were undergoing your new transformation and struggling to survive the process, all the undead that you had under your control slumped back to death again. A few of your acolytes picked up the slack, but given how many undead troops that suddenly dropped, it was still assumed that someone had killed you.  How surprising it was for Sinthinia when you went to meet her in private. The first being to be graced in the presence of your new form. Not surprisingly she didn’t recognize you at first, she’s even a little unnerved. You like that.  “Ah, lovely Sinthinia…you were quite right to choose me as an ally. Even in this new form I would still find it quite a shame to destroy such a beautiful form…” “…you? I thought…where the fuck have you been and…what the hell are you?”  “Hell. Hell’s exactly what I am.” You hideously laugh.  You proceed to explain the whole story since you feel in a mood to do so. She’s very fascinated by the process since even she didn’t know it was possible for a mortal to achieve something like this. She seems particularly intrigued by the fact that you’re in a lot of pain constantly.  She mentions that Velzix will probably start being more concerned with you, but of course you care not for such matters. You’ve defeated Death, you’ve cheated Hell, what’s one demon lord?"
7397,74,"Chapter 4: Damned    Five years have passed…  It’s been ten years since you allied with Velzix, an alliance that’s becoming more tenuous with each passing day.  Startled by your transformation and surge in power, Velzix proceeded to work extra hard on opening the portal, which he did...permanently. Velzix now has unlimited reinforcements, but you do as well. Your new found abilities allow you to not only summon the torments spirits of the infernal plane, but you soon were also able to raise dead demons as hellish undead. Something that couldn’t be accomplished before, by any being. Not even the Great Lich Lord. Combine this with your other regular necromantic abilities and you’re a severe threat with completely loyal troops who will have to be dealt with soon as far as Velzix is concerned. But for now, the alliance still stands. Your other “ally” Sinthinia still maintains her grip on her spy network, but it’s of little importance to you now. You’ve completely filled your holdings with undead be they former mortals or demons. None of them are going to rat on whatever it is you’re plotting.  As for the “Grand Alliance” it’s in its death rattle. The Zalan Empire has basically taken full control of it, but even with more of a unified leadership, this last hope for mortals is doomed. You don’t even know why they persist in struggling. You alone have pushed your undead hell legions towards the gates of the capitol yourself, beating that idiotic Tivadol to the punch. You hear of how he roars with rage at your successes.  Having accomplished this feat, and despite your transformation, your thoughts can’t help, but turn to your family. It’s been years since you’ve had any kind of direct contact with them. You know your Mom still lives in the capitol of the Zalan Empire and that your sister is still currently holding the last pitiful lines of defense there as a general.  As for your Dad…well you know exactly where he’s at right now. He’s in your dungeon. Sinthinia recently had him captured after he and his company had been waging an ongoing guerilla tactic campaign of irritating raids on Velzix’s Realm. When you found out, you insisted that he be brought to you and she was only too happy to oblige, knowing that your dislike of him, only grew and festered into full blown hatred after your transformation.  While it’s true you’re supposed to oversee the destruction of the Zalan capitol personally, you’re going to enjoy yourself in tormenting the one who sired you first.  You open the door to his cell and see a beaten and bloody old man. No longer is he the figure of intimidation that you once quaked in fear of when he was around. His wounds are recent from the lashes he’s been taking. You decided it would be best to start off with the basics before moving on to more elaborate tortures.  However, upon seeing you, he manages to compose himself the best he can.  “Ugh…too chicken shit to do your own dirty work, huh?” he says spitting blood. “I think you’ll find that by letting others do my dirty work, I’m actually showing mercy. Because when I starting doing it, you won’t be in any condition to perform this poor attempt of bravado.”  Your Dad finally stands up and addresses you more directly. He looks at you and shakes his head.  “You think by killing me, that you’re proving something? You ain’t proving shit boy except what a lousy disappointment you truly are. Now your sister, THERE’S a child to be proud of. Even yer mother gave up on you. Broke her heart you know that?”  You can’t believe this arrogance!  “Feh, aligning yourself with the hordes of hell, I always knew you were too weak to do anything on your own. You couldn’t even follow the path of darkness without help.” Your Dad mocks.  You don’t know how he’s doing this, but he’s actually managing to get to you. You’re tired of hearing this and you cast a spell that strips a portion of his skin off. He falls to the floor in pain.  “You will NOT dictate your judgment on me! I am beyond such things now, especially from the likes of you! A blood thirsty thug who committed more than a few atrocities in his day and up until I began my path of darkness, was still committing foul deeds under the guise of law. You are no better than me!” “Wrong again boy. I cleaned up my act…heh heh, okay maybe not completely. But I ain’t never got myself in league with demons. Let alone turn myself into some unnatural…thing. Yer dammed boy. And while you might think you’re going to be controlling everything, you ain’t. You don’t control hell boy, it controls you. Yer nothin’ but a slave to...”  “ENOUGH!” you shout and kick him before he can complete his sentence. The rage building up in you is enough to twist steel, but still your Dad mocks you. He’s laughing!  “Ha ha ha, broke yer mother’s heart…”  You don’t have time for this right now. You’re supposed to oversee the final attack of the Zalan capitol, and you’re still going to do that, and your Dad is going to feel the pain when you come back. In the meantime he can rot in his cell.  You arrive and the final attack is ordered. You storm the gates as cannons destroy multitudes of your troops only to be replaced with more. You see your sister on top of the battlements ordering her soldiers to fire upon you. During this attack you feel several bullets enter your body breaking through your magical defenses. You ignore the pain, as its nothing compared to what you’ve been exposed to.  Not stopping, you enter the gates of the city realizing that this was inevitable. Things could’ve only been this way. Your undead slay all those that oppose you, but you mentally make sure none of your undead has murderous intentions towards any of your family. You have special plans for them. You head towards your parent’s old house, taking little notice of the death around you.  When you arrive you find the house empty. In fact it looks like it’s been empty for months. So many memories here…a different time… even a different life now…  “She left when the attacks first came. She didn’t say where either. She just told me she was leaving. I even had her followed for awhile, but she was quite adept at eluding my scouts, not to mention I had other concerns to take care of.” Your sister says entering behind you.  “Mom always was smart, well except maybe when it came to Dad, but he’s rotting in my torture cell right now. So who cares?” you remark.  Your sister doesn’t make her sense of concern noticeable by your revelation, but instead looks upon you with complete disgust.  “I can’t believe you’ve let yourself become what you are. What you’ve done…” “I’ve found that one is capable of quite a bit, when one sets their mind to it. Even the demons fear me and I have only myself to congratulate. Soon they too will fall…perhaps this is a lingering sense of brotherly concern, but you could join me in this. You would be a great asset in the coming war with Velzix. Perhaps I could even help you transform as well.”  She spits on the floor, and then raises her magical glowing sword.  “I thought as much.”  You blast your sister with powerful beam of negative energy causing the color to drain from her face. She’s still continues towards you, but another blast causes her to fall.  She’s near death and your twisted mind still ponders what to do. Your sister was a great warrior, and you weren’t joking when she would be a great asset to you if she was on your side. You’re sure if given enough time and using the right magic rituals you could transform her like you did to yourself. Part of you also still has your Dad’s words of how she was someone to be proud of ringing in your head. Transforming her into a vessel of evil would be destroying that image in your mind."
7397,75,"Overcome with irrational hatred and jealousy of an opinion that technically shouldn’t matter to you at all, you grab your sister’s body and have dark plans for it. Even better, you’re going to have your Dad see exactly what you’re going to do. Two tortures in one.  You infuse her with a bit of unholy energy to keep her alive. As you’re leaving one of your mortal necromancers approaches you in the middle of the chaos.  “Uh sir, we’ve taken over the city. The royal family was butchered in their own throne room.” “Huh? Yeah, yeah. Well you know what to do, recruit the weak willed, kill the resisters, and raise the dead. I got more important things to do.”  You take your sister back to Aftermath and begin your work. You start to perform rituals and have your Dad watch every reprehensible act you do to your sister over the course of several weeks. She slowly goes from becoming a noble warrior to a malevolent murderer. She screams in pain from the vile assaults upon her mind and body. For the first time you think you’ve seen your Dad weep and display any kind of emotion. He even begs you to stop, which really make you smile.  When you’re ready to represent the final act of your work, you approach your Dad who’s a completely broken man at this point.  “See, and look upon your pride and joy now Dad. You were proud of her because she was everything she represented that you weren’t right? She shook off the brutality and replaced it with nobility. She wasn’t a self-serving mercenary; she was a duty bound fighter who believed in something. So much so that she was willing to try to kill me even though the odds were against her. She chose a path because it was what she BELIEVED in, not something she became due to falling under some spell like you did. Well guess what? I CHOSE my path too. And I’ve chose to turn your beloved daughter into you. Did you know she had the capacity for great evil already? Guess your genes are always there, no matter how much you try to deny them. I had to look deep, but I found that part of her. That darkest part of her hates, her violent tendencies, all of it. I nurtured and coaxed it out through…well I think you saw most of the process. Now behold my greatest achievement since my ascension.”  You sister comes from behind the door; she looks much different than from what your Dad remembers. No longer is she a force of good, but one of evil. Of course though you’ve made sure she’s totally obedient to you. The tormented hell soul that inhabits her body is completely under your command. It causes her great pain, but then again so are you. Why should you be the only one who suffers?  She sneers at you as she walks towards your Dad. You can feel her hatred toward you, yet she knows she cannot do anything toward you. Instead she takes it out on your Dad who can only give a mournful look of what she’s become before he’s hacked to bits in a bloody fury.  Yes, she will certainly be a terror on the battlefield, you think.    Ten years pass…  Twenty years have passed, and the world has tilted firmly into the grip of evil. Demons pour into this world more and more each day. The Grand Alliance is dead and the “civilized” governments of mortals have fallen to demonic hordes or your own undead ones. Pockets of resistance always exist, but they will soon fall in time as well.  With the success of your sister’s transformation, you proceeded to pick other powerful mortals and unnaturally twist them to your will, turning them into something more than demon, more than undead and certainly more than human. They are much like you except they are completely obedient to your will. They hate you of course for their painful existence, but is it not the way of all children to want to kill their father?  Perhaps Hell has changed you, but you’ve made quite a few changes to Hell…  Of more immediate concern is Velzix, who demanded years ago that you stop your experiments on mortals. He and most of the other pure blood demons already didn’t like the fact you could raise their dead, but they REALLY didn’t like how you were achieving something that they hadn’t thought of, let alone even accomplish. Of sure a few can possess a body, or turn an idiot to evil, but how many can create a whole new “race” of beings who are rivaling them in wickedness yet subservient to their creator? Of course you told Velzix to fuck off and there begun a civil war.  Your undead, mortal servants and Hellbred warriors now control your territory known as the Forsaken Dominion. Velzix still calls his territory “Velzix’s Realm” but it’s primarily inhabited by demons now, though mortal slave do serve them under their clawed heels. Neither place is particularly appealing to any right and good thinking being though.  Tivadol the Destroyer was the first fool to directly challenge you. He decided that if he could get you out of the way, he could prove that he was the ultimate warrior and easily take Velzix’s place. He soon found out how poor his judgment was, when your sister personally slew him on the battlefield and his now undead shell serves her every whim and take her every abuse. Sinthinia broke off her so called alliance with you, and somehow managed to ingratiate herself back in Velzix’s good graces. Perhaps your actions really have put the fear into them. Indeed there is less infighting occurring in Velzix’s Realm nowadays.  This new unified front the demons have put up is the only thing that’s really giving you problems as of late. Get them to start fighting amongst themselves again and you’ll be able to roll over them.  You were here first. You’re going to rule this world, nobody else.  You get an idea. You know the demons hate your new Hellbred creations yet you’re pretty sure Velzix wouldn’t mind having some on his side. He’s merely using this new found unity to his advantage, just like he’d use your creations to his advantage as well.  You decide to stage a small revolt, though you’re not telling anyone about it. Only you’ll know the truth. You figure your sister would be the best one to start with since it’s well known how much she loathes you even amongst the enemy.  The first revolt in the Dominion is set off by your sister. She slays several of your mortal servants, some of them even necromancers. Undead die by the droves. You could care less. This is for a greater goal and after all, you’ll just raise them again later. The second revolt occurs next and then another. By the end of the month several of your Hellbred warriors have rebelled and some have even acquired small contingencies of mortal followers.  All of this grabs Velzix’s attention. He moves in to take your weakened areas, but he also sends feelers out to these rebel Hellbreds. Since this was supposed to be impossible he’s very interested to see if he can use them against you…  Excellent the first part of the plan is set.  He has Sinthinia approach them, as he’s still too smart to directly face them. The cowardly demon lord hasn’t left his magically fortified inner chamber in years. Of course Sinthinia has her own personal guards approach them first since she’s not risking her life either. Of course the Hellbreds act appropriately hostile and suspicious, but mention how much they hate being used as your pawns and how arrogant you were to think that you could control them just because you created them. They want nothing more than your death.  That response is enough for Velzix to start offering them positions in his armies. They accept of course. At first they’re just kept to their own units, but after Velzix wins some territory from you (More than he has in years) he realizes their efficiently would be better spread out to maximize there fighting skills and strategic minds. He begins to have them lead demon contingencies.  This doesn’t go over well.  Part two of the plan has come about.  Soon the demons begin to resent Velzix’s decision. Saying that he’s favoring these Hellbreds over them. Velzix tell them he’ll do what he wants as he’s the leader and what he says goes. Sinthinia doesn’t like this either and mentions that he’s stirring trouble by pursuing this course of action and she doesn’t like the fact that she can’t sense what they’re thinking or feeling like a normal (or not so normal) living creature, but Velzix insists he’s doing the right thing since he’s winning the war against you now.  It doesn’t take long before the demons revert back to their chaotic natures and start getting disobedient with their new Hellbred “companions”. Now you have your Hellbred stop holding back and lash out which they do in violent ways. This of course causes the death of several Hellbreds, but these acts cause a greater spiral of destruction.  Demons begin fighting among themselves again, arguing that Velzix doesn’t know what the fuck he’s doing and isn’t worth following since he trusted these creatures to lead. Velzix has REAL rebellions going on all over his Realm. Portions of it begin to split away from the whole and several demons begin forming their own warlord domains. Domains that you easily conquer as you bring your full unified force to bear. Eventually Velzix’s reputation isn’t strong enough anymore and he can’t bring enough reinforcements anymore to help, as the knowledge of his failures have spread even to the infernal planes. In fact he has to close up his portal just so other opportunistic demon lords don’t come around to finish him off, he’s having enough problems with you. You get the impression that Sinthinia had something to do with that as she disappeared soon after this elaborate deception came about. (Possibly her “parting shot” at Velzix who she never had any true loyalty to anyway and fled back to the infernal plane to save her own skin)  Now the endgame begins  Your sister storms Velzix’s fortress with an army larger than the one used to storm the Zalan capitol ten years ago. You never even have to dirty your hands, and you heard he was slain with ease by your sister. When she presents his head to you, you do something you haven’t done in a long time. Grant act of mercy.  “You’ve served me well dear sister, let this be your final reward.”  You snuff out the tormented spirit inhabiting your sister which releases her from her painful servitude and allows her to die.  Now nothing stands in your way, Velzix’s hasty actions of closing the portal have made things even easier for you. No longer do you have to deal with these interloping demons any longer. You’ve suffered their kind long enough. Even from the very beginning when Big Red gave you shit when you tried to buy a book on necromancy from him, how long ago that was...  You vow to have every last one of them killed."
7397,76,"Thirty years pass…  It’s been fifty years since you set out on the path of darkness.  Every demon on this world has indeed been hunted down and killed. If any still exist, they’ve found the deepest darkest hole to hide in and you’re even having those searched. Mortal resistance is non-existent. You’ve stomped out every wannabe hero/last hope/chosen one whenever they’ve presented themselves. Such idealism is the past. A few times there have been a few of your necromancer underlings that have attempted to have you killed, but such attempts are futile and the conspirators are typically caught, tortured and then killed.  Most mortals know better than to stand against you now though. You have done something remarkable in your cruel iron fist and that is the fact you’ve brought peace to the world at last. Nobody fights on any meaningful major scale anymore. All mortals, from the lowliest goblin to the haughtiest elf (Though there aren’t too many of the latter left) all obey your terrible will and seek to become one of your many undead minions when they ultimately die. Their “afterlife”.  They cannot hope to stand against no less than a god.  Are you a god though?  After all is it not you who drove the demons from the world? Is it not you who created the Hellbred? Is it not you who has achieved world peace? Is it not you who is complete master of life and death? Is it not you who continues to suffer your agonizing existence merely to give these fools some purpose in their lives?  Where are all the gods of “old” anyway? Why did they allow this to happen? Why have they not stopped you, if this was not destined to happen?  You’re of the mind that the gods of this world either never existed or cowered in fear of your rising power and abandoned it long ago.  While you ponder these questions in the solitude of your study and decide that you ARE a god, you are suddenly visited by the contrary.  “Well, well, well, this turned out a lot better than I expected. I guess it was good I placed my faith in you…ha ha faith. Probably not the most appropriate word, but I can’t think of a better one right now.”  You turn around to see a face you thought dead long ago. Even you are surprised, and that rarely happens nowadays. How he got in here you have no idea.  “Big Red?” “Yep, it’s me.” “I saw you dead. Years ago.” “Oh that, yeah well let’s just say that wasn’t me or at least no the real me. Doesn’t matter. This world is ready for the infernal plane.” “Excuse me? Just because you have somehow managed to cheat death, do not presume that you can challenge me. I am god here. This world is mine and mine alone.”  Big Red laughs and then you feel a sudden paralysis over come you. Powerful magic is at work here and you can’t do anything about it. Your anger rages.  “This world COULD’VE been yours, had you chosen a different path, tis true. But the day you came to me, was the day that path ended. I knew a change in this world was coming long before you showed up, and not necessarily one in my favor. The stench of death had risen once more just like in the days before the Great Lich Lord,. in fact I was already to haul my red ass back to the infernal realm. I already went through that shit once, didn’t feel like dealing with it again. Mortals are certainly fun to be around, but the undead…never cared for them. If they were going to retake this world, I saw no point in staying. Demons are indeed assholes, but hey I can related to them.” “When I get free, I’m going to make you beg for death!” you yell while he continues his speech. “However, when you came to me, I could sense the great power of necromancy flowing in you. Oh sure Mr. Demar and his motley crew THOUGHT they were dark wizards, but their power paled in comparison to what I sensed in you. I thought about killing you right then and there to stop the possible dead onslaught, but then I thought why do that, when I can bend and taint you to infernal purposes?” “You didn’t do shit! I DID THIS ALL!” “I’m sure you think so, and that’s exactly what I wanted you to believe. Those necromantic books you took from my place when you found my dead body were infused with hell magic, secret languages from my home. Of course if you had been a little more experienced in such matters you might’ve caught on, but you were too eager to start raising the dead to not realize that the seeds were slowly taking root in your mind. I watched you turn slowly away from the purity of death and begin to consort with demons. The moment you allied with that blowhard Velzix I knew then the seeds had taken started to bloom.” “NO! You’re lying!” “It was a good thing that my plan worked too, because it stunted your potential power. The purity of your unnatural link to the dead was spoiled and ultimately severed long ago. Who knows how powerful you could’ve gotten had I not intervened? Maybe you would’ve surpassed the Great Lich Lord. Why you might’ve ascended into godhood. Scary to think about the road not traveled eh?” “LIAR! LIAR!” “Well okay I can’t take credit for ALL your decisions, but come on. When you began summoning tormented souls from the infernal realm, did you really think you could’ve gotten away with that without some kind of help? You were STEALING from Hell. Then when you transformed yourself you were going beyond normal hubris. Not even our kind has the balls to defy Hell itself. You wouldn’t believe how hard it was to convince the high ups to let you get away with it. Your Hellbred experiment made things even worse, but in the end it was all worth it. Hell’s getting an entire world in return and their stolen souls back.”  This revelation…you don’t want to believe it, but somehow the hard reality is crashing down upon you, and the paralysis wears off and you suddenly feel completely drained as you fall to the floor.  “No…no…I was in control the whole time…I’m just…just a puppet…a slave…” “We’re ALL slaves to Hell, my dead friend. Its just all of the question how high up you are in the hierarchy you are. You might’ve been allowed some leniency, and been allowed to be my second in command, but as I said your grand theft soul displeased the high ups. So you gotta pay. Pay dearly I’m afraid. Shame really, you really were quite efficient at your work, but having someone like you around would’ve been dangerous to my well being anyway. I think Sinthinia will be more fun than you’d be as well. She’s proved a most useful spy and saboteur through this whole endeavor. She was the one who told you to look behind the toilet for the necromantic books fifty years ago after all.”  Its just one deception upon another as the plot has unfolded to prove how you were lead down the path to Hell. Now there’s just one more thing as you’re crumpled miserably on the floor hoping that all of this is some bad dream, but of course when Big Red crouches next to you and grabs your wrist this is all too real.  “It’s been said time and time again, but you chose to ignore it. You don’t change Hell, Hell changes you. And it’s changed not only you, but this world as well. Time for both of you to come home necromancer.”  And with these last words, the entire world is transported into the infernal plane where Big Red is allowed to run it as he sees fit. All your undead and Hellbred are destroyed instantly as your powers are stripped away immediately. Hell gave you your powers, and now it’s taking them away. Drawing back ALL its energy it ever gave you.  You now lay in some forsaken deep pit of Hell completely helpless. You have nothing to defend yourself against the demonic torments that you now suffer. Physically, mentally and especially spiritually.  Your punishment is eternal and not even the power of death can save you."
7397,77,"A fleeting thought of vicious cruelty all to get back at your Dad crosses your mind, but leaves you. You don’t need to bother proving anything. You know who you are. The old man is defeated and he’ll be dealt with when you get back. The second reason is you wish to remain unique; transforming your sister into something similar to you would be destroying that.  “Well sis, this is where we say good bye, you may thank me for this mercy I’m displaying. Dad won’t be so lucky.” You say and snuff out the last bit of her life essence and leave the house. As you’re leaving one of your mortal necromancers approaches you in the middle of the chaos.  “Uh sir, we’ve taken over the city. The royal family was butchered in their own throne room.” “Good. Well you know what to do next, recruit the weak willed, kill the resisters, and raise the dead. I got more important things to do.”  You return to Aftermath where you inform your Dad of his beloved daughter’s death and how she died mewling and begging like a pathetic stuck Halfling. You also mention he won’t get to die with half as much dignity.  His torment stretches for months before his body at last gives out. Lasted longer than you expected, but then again he was always tough.  Ten years pass…    Twenty years have passed, and the world has tilted firmly into the grip of evil. Demons pour into this world more and more each day. The Grand Alliance is dead and the “civilized” governments of mortals have fallen to demonic hordes or your own undead ones. Pockets of resistance always exist, but the damage they do is negligible. There is little hope left.  As for your own “alliance” that also no longer exists. You and Velzix couldn’t exist together any longer and the need to destroy each other was finally unleashed. The land is split and your territory is known as the Forsaken Dominion. The war goes on for years in a bloody seesaw event.  Tivadol the Destroyer attempts to raise his own status by trying to launch an all out assault upon you. Hoping that by killing you personally, everyone will see he’s a better leader than Velzix. His fanatical berserker troops do much damage initially, but soon even they fall before the relentless hordes of undead. By the time Tivadol gets to the inner reaches of your lands, he’s fighting by himself. He dies in an onslaught of wraiths, wrights, skeletons and all other manner of undead.  Sinthinia who once again sided with Velzix during this split sends some of her personal assassins after you. More than a few times they nearly ended your existence. With each one you killed you had their corpses kept in a cell. Then when you felt you had enough of them in your possession, you raised them and ordered them to use their skills to kill Sinthinia and Velzix. Velzix proved to evade this fate, but Sinthinia wasn’t so lucky and died by the hands of her own assassins.  Still even with these successes, you aren’t gaining too much ground. Velzix just replenishes his army with more demons coming from the infernal plane. The only way to stop that from happening is to close the motherfucker, and quite frankly you’re about the only one on your side powerful enough to do it. You prepare to make a large scale attack into Velzix’s Realm.  After a long hard fight you manage to close the infernal portal, cutting off his troop supply. Of course after having done this, you realize you’re already deep in his territory. He’s close. Why stop there? He’ll just open it again later, and you ARE trying to kill him…  Not stopping, you assault his nearby fortress Fury. With each demon you kill they cut down ten of your undead. They make you pay for every success, to the point that you even have to conserve some of your energy to stop raising the dead to replenish your losses. You’ve expended enough as it is closing the portal, you’ll need all you have to defeat Velzix.  Eventually you reach Velzix’s inner chamber. He bellows and makes his usual threats of how he’s going to make you pay and such. It’s all so boring now. You’ve heard it all before. You don’t bother with your own remarks, because you’ve also said it all before too.  The pair of you engage in combat, casting every terrible spell imaginable and destroying portions of the fortress in the process. For years the world has suffered under the both of you, and little by little hope died. However, perhaps after this battle hope shall once again live. For the level of evil will definitely be vastly diminished after this day.  You fight with much ferocity, but at last Velzix catches you off guard and lands a crippling blow. He wastes no time in following up and after he’s done, you can even feel yourself losing grip on the hellish magics keeping you alive. However, you vow if you’re not winning neither is Velzix. You expend your last bit of power and blast Velzix in the face with a combination of negative energy and hellfire. He reels back from you and falls. You then force the tormented soul in your body to exit and enter inside Velzix and command it to wreak havoc on his internal organs out from the inside.  Velzix’s howls as his organs explode and his body is ripped apart. It’s the last thing you hear as you die a final death with a smile on your face."
7397,78,"You don’t trust her, and you’d be a fool to do so, so you play dumb.  “Sorry Sinthinia, but I don’t know what you’re talking about. I sometimes talk to Sesisek, and while he does scheme, I can assure you that I’m not part of them. I have no wish to side with a loser like him.”  Sinthinia stops the seduction routine and eyes you suspiciously. A pity since you were enjoying her fondling.  “Very well necromancer. Play your little game. I hope for your sake that you’re telling the truth, because if you aren’t, I think you’ll find that I play this game a lot better and I won’t be offering this opportunity again.”  Sinthinia walks out of your study and you dismiss her threats.  A few days pass and you meet Sesisek in the forsaken area known as the Drozz Wasteland. The barbarian tribes here still hold sway, but you need not concern yourself with such minor threats, they know enough to stay away from two dark individuals such as yourselves, and the others…  The others in question are vampires. It would appear that Sesisek has been planning more than just “normal” betrayal. The vampires eye you warily.  You’re about to speak when all of a sudden Sinthinia materializes not to far away from this meeting spot.  “Ah thank you necromancer, your help in exposing Sesisek’s collaboration with vampires will be rewarded!” she exclaims. “YOU BETRAYED ME TO THAT BITCH!?!” Sesisek bellows “She’s lying! I never…”  You don’t get a chance to finish your explanation before a dozen or so of Sinthinia’s personal guards also materialize and attack. You’re temporarily so distracted by this that you don’t react in time to avoid Sesisek’s blow to your head, knocking you senseless to the ground.  When you come to, you find yourself tied up and on your knees before Sinthinia while being held roughly by her guards. You’re still in the Drozz plains, but you’re not going anywhere. You can’t cast any spells with your mouth gagged and your hands bound.  “Well, I told you I could play this game better. I’m sure if he could Sesisek would agree with you.”  You look over you your left and see Sesisek lying on the ground in a bloody pitiful state and being kicked mercilessly by more of her guards.  “However, your fate shall be much kinder than the one that awaits him. After all I do have to reward you.”  Sinthinia strokes your face gently and then abruptly claws your eyes out with the same hand. This is followed by a tearing sensation in your chest. If you could still see, you would be looking directly at your heart being ripped out before you.  You fall to the ground and are left there to be eaten by passing beasts."
7397,79,"You’re not going to be anyone’s puppet. You can handle Velzix yourself.  “Get out of here, I don’t need your help! In fact I’d say dealing with a loser like you would put me in a worse position. Go scheme elsewhere.”  Your words cause Sesisek to give you a look of mixed disapproval, disappointment and disgust. He quite obviously doesn’t like your insults, but he was also hoping that you’d help him. All he can do now is attempt to save what little pride he has and leave.  “Very well little necromancer, you think you know best, I’ll leave you to it. You’ll never be one of us though and that’s why your pitiful lifespan here will be even shorter than normal. Enjoy your victory, it will be your last.” He remarks and leaves you.  You dismiss his warnings and attempt to prepare yourself for Velzix’s visit. You come up with how you’re going to explain your actions to Velzix. A couple days pass and you hear about The Grand Alliance army breaking off their siege. Velzix will be coming soon.  Velzix arrives and you’re readying every spell and summoning you can think of. If it does go down, you’ll have to act quickly. You’re actually surprised he’s coming down here instead of summoning you to his fortress instead.   “So little necromancer, I hear you have been taking matters into your own hands and acquiring territory yourself. I am displeased that you have done this. The Grand Alliance has been attacking and you’ve been squandering my potential reinforcements elsewhere. What if they had succeeded in breaking through my defenses? I would’ve had no troops to support my position, and much would’ve been lost.” “Well if that had happened I guess I would’ve had to take over.”  That remark wasn’t the best one you could’ve made, but you can’t contain yourself for some reason. By Velzix’s statement alone, you’re sensing weakness in him, weakness that you could take advantage of. Why should you have to explain your actions? In the meantime Velzix is barely containing his anger at your arrogance.  “Tread VERY carefully mortal! Do not presume that you are not expendable! You are NOT a demon, do not attempt to play this game in which you are ill equipped to play. You are under MY command! Normally I would kill you for your insolence, but your recent victory has been a great one from what reports I have heard. However, it is MY territory! Not yours! Do not think that you are going to build up some power base to betray me later, because that is not going to happen if you value your existence! So you better just put such thoughts out of your mind right now and fall in line!”  Velzix hasn’t raised his voice too much, but there is definitely a very real threat there. The temperature of the room is much hotter as you can feel the heat from his body rise with his anger.  If you’re going to make a move, you better do it now."
7397,80,"You make the first move…  A huge battle ensues, you summon up shadows and wraiths to your aid while Velzix attempts to rip you limb from limb. Soon the others in Aftermath are drawn into the fight as well, most of the demons side with Velzix, the mortal troops tend to just get out of the way, while your undead are loyal as always.  This battle causes damage to Aftermath not seen since the Dark Order attempted to take it over. You certainly have the upper and hand, and Velzix realizes that you’re more powerful than he thought, but unfortunately for you, he manages to get away.  “LITTLE MORTAL YOU HAVE NOT WON THIS DAY! YOU WILL SOON COME TO BEG FOR DEATH WHEN I HAVE YOUR BROKEN FUCKING BODY BROUGHT BEFORE ME IN CHAINS!” he bellows before flying away.  You’re left with a city in shambles, but at last free of any ideas of servitude, as well as a large portion of territory yourself. You now have some breathing room. Of course you now have more enemies, but you’re confident that you’ll be able to handle the troubles ahead.  Four years pass…  Five years have passed since you took control of Aftermath, and now that’s coming to an end.  After your treachery against Velzix, he was so consumed with rage over it that he ordered constant attacks on you even at the expense of his own defenses. This not only weakened your position, but his as well, allowing the Grand Alliance army to break through and retake the Tulan Kingdom. Velzix and his cohorts were all slain. After this occurred, most of the demons fled into the wilderness only to be hunted down and killed. A few even ran to you, you accepted them since you needed all the help you could get at that point.  After taking care of Velzix, The Grand Alliance wasted no time in attacking you. You tried to maintain your holdings, but ultimately you lost your grip on the Brot Kingdom, when the royal family there once again switched alliances (Though to no avail as the Grand Alliance took them all into custody and had them executed for treason) Soon you were just left with Aftermath. When the Grand Alliance wasn’t trying to break down the gates, you had vampire assassins attempting to kill you.  In fact right now, you are dying from several deep blade wounds from their latest attack. The last bastard must’ve used some sort of assassin’s blade that doesn’t allow you to heal, because you’re bleeding out like a hemophiliac. Oh well, at least you killed him.    The Grand Alliance is also outside. Damn vampires probably set this up so you really wouldn’t be able to escape. Funny that you worried about Velzix and his crew killing you for so long, and it was some bloodsuckers that got you.  Things are getting dark now; you can hear Grand Alliance troops breaking down your fortress door. Well they’ll never take you alive that’s for sure.  You wonder exactly what went wrong and if you could’ve done things differently. You curse your lack of proper planning and regret your choices as they have ultimately lead you to ruin.  You lie on the floor, you see armored troops stand around you; one of them is your sister. She looks at you sternly with her sword at your throat, which is pretty pointless considering that you’re obviously near death already. Looks like she has a higher rank than you last remember. Good for her, at least one of you made something of your lives.  “…congrat…on your…promotion…” are your last words before she finishes you off."
7397,81,"As much as your desire is there to kill Velzix, your caution overtakes you. You do exactly what Velzix requests.  “…the territory is yours …I have no control over it.” You say and even make a little bow. You feel disgusted with yourself for even doing that, but Velzix is quite pleased. He’s broken you a little.  “Yes it is, and I’m glad to see you’ve gotten with the program. The less pride one has, the more likely one is to survive and in the end, that’s what it’s all about. Now, we shall never have another incident like this again I trust?” “…no…” “Good, now I think the best place for you, would be directly by my side where you can be more useful.” “What?!” “Sure, I could shore up my defenses in the heart of my realm, and place more elite troops on the front lines. Plus I think it would be a good idea to keep a closer eye on you. Just to make sure you don’t forget your place.”  Meekishly, you travel back with Velzix and become a permanent fixture in his fortress Fury. You really hate it there as you’re watched constantly; it’s unbearably hot all the time and have to put up with more demons than you did in Aftermath. Predictably they’re all hostile towards you, “loyal” to Velzix and set your zombies on fire for laughs regularly.  Four years pass…  It’s been five years since you made your alliance with Velzix and you fucking hate it even more than ever.  While you’ve managed to still carve out a niche for yourself, your position is increasingly becoming in danger of being obsolete. Velzix has been successful in keeping infernal portals open longer which is allowing more demons to come in. The Grand Alliance has been hard pressed to hold the line and it seems like more and more mortals each day are willing to bend before demonic might.  Your undead troops aren’t even necessary for defense too much anymore. Because of this you’ve been forced to broaden your magical horizons and tap into the infernal plane. It’s only due to the fact that you’ve been delving into darker necromantic magic and fusing it with infernal powers to create potent unnatural abominations that you’re still serving your purpose.  However, this type of magic is highly experimental and you’re probably the first one to even attempt it. It’s beginning to take a toll on your rapidly deteriorating health, because as they say, you don’t change hell, hell changes you. Everyday you’re in pain and probably losing what little of your black soul you have left. If this keeps up, you won’t be around long enough to see Velzix achieve his goal of opening up his permanent portal which looks like is might be soon.  You haven’t heard anything of your family, except you know that your sister is a captain of a Grand Alliance army and your Dad’s mercenary company has been hired to launch on going raids to harass and hinder Velzix’s efforts. Your Mom is probably saddened by your actions.  You’re just another mortal submitting to demonic supremacy. It’s a long way from what you originally envisioned for yourself and it’s probably too late for you to do anything about it now…or is it?  Recent reports have spoken of another assassination plan on Velzix. It’s known that the vampires have been sending their own, but haven’t gotten anywhere close to him. A few “heroes” from the civilized governments have been sent as well, but none of them have been successful either.  However, if you could locate one of these groups and try to help them get to Velzix, maybe you could at least get some sort of satisfaction. You don’t really have anything else to lose at this point."
7397,82,"You failed to kill Velzix when you had the chance five years ago when this alliance was being proposed, then again four years ago after you conquered Brot, maybe you can make for lost time. And as they say, third time’s a charm.  You have no idea how you’re going to accomplish this though, it’s not like you have some sort of contacts then it hits you; why not go see Sesisek? You know he’s still harboring desires of revenge and he’s supposed to be returning to Fury soon  You wait a week attempting to plan for this proposal, but you know its really going to come down to “Hey Sesisek, I’m going to kill Velzix, do you want to help or not?” In fact that’s exactly what happens, when you catch him in an empty hallway. He looks at you with a smirk on his face. You almost expect him to think that you’re setting him up, but he can tell by your pitiful state that you’re speaking the truth.  “Sooo, finally wised up eh? You know, you wouldn’t be in this condition had you taken my help four years ago. I dunno. I’ve got my own plans, why should I involve you in them?” “Because I do still have power. Power that can help you take out Velzix and regain respect among your own kind. You’re talking to a desperate man here, I don’t even care if I die at this point, I just need to get my own revenge on Velzix.” “You and multitudes of others. You’re not special. However, you are desperate. And you are powerful. Dangerous combination. Very well, I’ll talk with you further, but let’s go some place less likely to be listened in on.”  You and Sesisek speak in your study. He is very open about his plan to you and explains that he has been in contact with Lord Rostov and working out a deal with the Vampire Clans that will be beneficial to him. This deal could be extended to you as well, provided you are helpful enough. Another group of vampire assassins have managed to make their way into the heart of Velzix’s Realm, but if they are to strike they need to do it now, before Sinthinia’s internal security forces sniff them out once again. Sesisek’s job was to sneak them into Fury without too much opposition, given that you’re in on this plan now, you could do a better job since your necromantic magic could mask the vampire assassins’ movements. He mentions he will set up the plan and while you and the bloodsuckers are heading to Velzix’s chamber, Sesisek says he will be dealing with Sinthinia personally. It will also provide a diversion.  A day passes and you’re preparing yourself for the battle of your life. You memorize every powerful spell you can think of and strengthen up your undead minions. When this goes down there is no turning back, so you’re just going to order all of them to attack the moment Sesisek’s attack on Sinthinia becomes known and an alarm is raised. Hopefully the added chaos will help.  Another day passes and Sesisek sees you fairly early in the morning. He mentions that the assassins will meet you by the dead forest nearby when darkness falls. He hopes you’ve prepared yourself, because it was very hard to convince them in this change of plans.  When darkness comes, you take a few of your hellish undead abominations with you and make your way to the dead forest. Once fairy folk and the like frolicked here, now it’s just a group of desiccated tree husks waiting to be taken away to build more war machines. Your powers in necromancy aren’t quite as pure as they used to be thanks to the tainting of hellish magics, but you can still sense the assassins are close by. You aren’t taken by surprised when they materialize around you. Indeed you have your abominations to act if they try anything.  “So, you’re Velzix’s little necromancer eh? You don’t look like much.” One of them says. “Maybe, but you ain’t getting in that fortress without me. You think Sesisek could’ve snuck you in? Please. The moment you entered, you would’ve been detected. Sinthinia’s got magic detection up the ass in that place. Fortunately I can mask your presence, just make sure you all stay invisible until the right time.” “Don’t worry about us, you just hold up your end and get us to Velzix, necromancer.”  You make your trek back to Fury, without incident with your hidden friends in tow. You take a deep breath before entering the gates where upon you half expect the demon guards to stop you, but nothing happens. You’ve succeeded. Your next move is to get as quickly as possible to Velzix’s inner chambers.  You don’t get far when an alarm is raised, you think it’s for you at first, but you soon realize its Sesisek doing his part. You hope it’s enough of a distraction, but if it isn’t…  You mentally call out to your undead minions to attack anything living.  “Come on! Secrecy is over! We gotta haul ass to Velzix!” you exclaim.  While chaos is reigning in the fortress, you and the vampires easily dispatch those that would attempt to stop you. When you get to Velzix’s inner chambers where he’s attempting to open up a portal to get reinforcements.  “Treachery! I expected this from Sesisek, but I thought you learned your place! No matter, you will learn pain instead, and your blood leech buddies won’t be able to help you either!”  Velzix’s portal opens and a swarm of demons come pouring out. The vampire assassins waste no time and begin their work with deadly efficiency. Your abominations have less finesse, but they get the job done.  Velzix unleashes horrible infernal magic that causes a couple of the assassins to liquefy. You’re just trying to stay out of the way of most of the fighting and attempting to keep a control over your troops, but you soon realize you’re going to have to play a direct role in his death and unleash your own negative energy bolts at Velzix.  The battle is brutal, and dead bodies soon litter the chamber. You’ve suffered a mortal wound, but it hardly matters now. Deep down you didn’t expect to survive this. Velzix isn’t either though. Sesisek arrives just in time to slam an axe in his back while he was finishing off the last vampire assassin.  Velzix roars in pain, but falls to the floor where upon Sesisek pulls out a second weapon, a sword and severs his head from his body.  It’s done. Velzix is dead and you don’t feel too much different. You’re still dying and you’re not hopeful that Sesisek is going to help you out.  “Ha ha! Vengence is mine! Velzix and that bitch are both dead!” he yells in triumph “Uh huh, great…” “Yes…well it looks like you’re hurt pretty badly there. I don’t think I can do anything for you. In fact I need to make my escape. I think you’ll understand if leave you here. After all you would only slow me up and I may have lied about my deal being extended to you anyway.” “…yeah…I sorta figure that…” you say holding on to your bleeding side. “Besides, you got your revenge and that is what you wanted right? I can honestly say though I couldn’t have done it without you.” “I can honestly say something too…I’m still nobody’s puppet.”  You hit Sesisek in the face with a negative energy blast. He screams as it strikes his eyes. He collapses on the floor blindly reaching for a weapon yelling about how he’s going to kill you. You smile though as more demons come to the inner chamber and butcher Sesisek while he’s on all fours like some sightless dog.  You then give way to the release of blessed death."
7397,83,"You’ve given up on hope or anything else a long time ago. Even if you could contact one of these groups, Sinthinia would probably sniff out the attempt due to her constant internal security measures, and you’re being watched a lot anyway.  Nope, you’ve resigned yourself to a fate of subservience.  Five years pass…  Ten years have passed since your deal with Velzix, and you’ve lived long enough just in time to see the world being slowly turned into a demon’s playground due to him finally opening up a permanent portal to his infernal realm. Already he preparing to use the resources and conquests of this world to attack other demon lords in his home plane.  You won’t be alive for too much longer though. You’re no longer necessary to Velzix for one thing, and the second is that your hellish dealings have finally become fatal; even now death is very near. The only thing that’s kept you going this long is your unnatural ties to necromancy that have steadily grown weaker over the years. You can only wonder what might’ve been had you been allowed to let them grow to full bloom. You think back to when you conquered the Brot Kingdom by yourself. Ah, that was a good time. There was purity in the death you caused there. Since then you’ve seen much more death, but rarely have you had any hand in it yourself.  Your Dad died during an attempted raid on Velzix’s fortress. Sinthinia had her guards butcher him and his company before he even managed to sneak inside.  Sesisek was killed when it was discovered he had come to an “arrangement” with the vampire clans and was collaborating with them in an assassination attempt. During his last pain filled moments he revealed their location and Lord Rostov and his vampire clan were slain in their secret fortress by Velzix himself  Not long ago the capitol of the Zalan Empire was razed to the ground by Tivadol the Destroyer. A place you once called home. You heard your sister died attempting to defend it. You can only assume your Mom died during the attack as well. The Grand Alliance has been broken, all that remains now are pocket of resistance that do little to stop the demonic onslaught. At this point most mortals find death a more promising outcome as it is surely a more merciful release to the torments that the demons bring. You wish you could grant it to them.  You regret you set out on this dark path. It’s brought you nothing but fucking misery and you didn’t even get what you wanted. Well you might not have lived how you wanted, but you sure can choose to die like you want.  You order a few of your skeletal guards to end your suffering. The pain wracking your body has become too great and you’re not going to wait around for it or demons to kill you.  Following your last orders your skeletal guards strike you down with their swords. Their work is efficient and swift. You fall to the floor and soon your minions of death join you."
7397,84,"You decide that military conquest would be too risky and would draw too much attention to your desires for power. You need to be sneakier about it.  After thinking on it, you decide to go for Sinthinia. She’s in the best position to help you, so you send a message telling her that you need to see her since it’s an important matter vital to security.  A few days later she arrives in Aftermath with a small group of guards. Of course the pair of you talk in your study in private. Her attitude is one of interest and playfulness.  “Brrr, it’s really cold in this place. It’s not nice and warm like in other parts of Velzix’s Realm. See how hard my nipples are?” “Yes, I see. Perhaps I can warm you up after we discuss business.” “Mmmm, I like the sound of that, but only if this business is worth my time. So what is this security matter?” “Assassination.” “On who?” “On Velzix.” “Well it was bound to happen eventually, though I’m surprised I haven’t heard about this yet. Who is planning it and how did you come across this information?”  You take a deep breath.  “I came across this information quite easily because it’s me.”  Sinthinia is silent for a moment before giving a little chuckle.  “Ha ha, very funny.” “I’m serious.” “I know and that’s why I find it funny. You do not have the means.” “I know that’s why I’m proposing an alliance between us to set Velzix up.” “I see…and you believed that I would just go along with this?” “Well it’s a gamble. But I KNOW you truly have no loyalty to Velzix, surely you must already be plotting against him.” “And even if I was doing such a thing…hypothetically speaking of course. I fail to see why I’d need your help to do so.” “Because somewhere deep down Velzix fears me, I know it. He wants me as an underling to take advantage of my powers. But he doesn’t allow me to do too much since he wants to keep me weak and have an eye on me. I have more power than he’s willing to admit and if I unleashed it completely on him, he’d be hurting. I dare say I might be able to kill him. I just can’t fight all of his minions obviously. I would need your help.”  Once again Sinthinia is silent for a moment before speaking.  “…I must say you have always intrigued me mortal. You do have a lot of desire in you to come to me like this with such a plan, knowing that I could turn you in and have Velzix deal with you…fortunately for you I have no such plan.” Sinthinia says and begins to get closer to you. Her movements begin to grind up against you.  “So tell me, do you really feel you have that much power?” she asks. “Yes.” “More power than Velzix?” “Yes.” “Then show me lover.” She says and the pair of you fall to the floor in a zealous embrace.    While you’re enjoying Sinthinia’s sexual skills, she begins to get more aggressive. In fact she begins to get abusive. You tell her to stop, but at this point she’s transformed into something a lot less appealing, and you’re lying underneath her helpless as she pins your arms down and begins sucking out your life force.  “Yes, mortal you DID have much power within you. It will certainly come in handy for Velzix’s eventual overthrow.” She growls and you become nothing more than an empty husk."
7397,85,"You nearly laugh at the idea that you have any “allies”. A more appropriate designation would be “The folks who are currently on your side because it’s advantageous at the moment”. Velzix doesn’t trust any of them either despite the fact that they all knew and worked with each other in the infernal plane. (Actually he doesn’t trust any them BECAUSE of the fact that they all knew and worked with each other!) Given that fact, you probably shouldn’t either.  Oddly, you don’t worry about your enemies as much as you do your allies, mainly because at least you know where you stand with them!"
7397,86,"Your “boss” is the currently the undisputed Lord of “Velzix’s Realm”. Not a very imaginative designation, but true none the less. He rules from his huge fortress called Fury which is the “capitol” of his Realm. He was something of a greater power in his own infernal plane once, but apparently lost most of it as power is often fleeting in such a place of constant struggle.  Still, he refused to give up and was in the long slow process of rebuilding his status until the Dark Order summoned and bound him to your world. He was angry at first, which of course is natural for any demon (or anyone in captivity really) but soon he recognized this as an opportunity. A whole world he could take over and use to increase his own power. A place he could be complete master over after he made it more like home of course. He is making sure to make this plan becomes a reality.  Besides being very intelligent and strong, he’s also quite charismatic for a demon, which accounts for why he’s managed to unite his brethren more successfully than most. Though of course in-fighting still occurs, it’s kept in check for the most part.  Velzix is definitely aware that most of his followers are secretly planning his downfall, he expects it in fact. After all it’s a way of life where he comes from. He considers part of the challenge is to keep everyone slightly at odds with everyone else so they can’t unite against him. (Which is exactly what happened in his own plane)  His attitude towards you is uncharacteristically one of respect. You might even say he treats you equal to his other high ranking demons rather than a mortal. (Though given how he treats his fellow demons that’s not saying much) Most other mortals that serve him have sold their souls for power and slavishly worship him or are serving mainly out of fear whereas you have chosen to serve out of ruthless pragmatism and in some ways still follow your own path.  Though following your own path to the point where it’s interfering with his own, would be quite detrimental to your…alliance.   Sinthinia is a succubus, she is sometimes Velzix’s “consort”, but such things as fidelity are not a trait known to demons, let alone a succubus. Officially she’s supposed to be in charge of internal security, but occasionally she undertakes a few “diplomatic” missions in an attempt to corrupt weak minded mortals who could be of use.  Velzix enjoys her company, but knows to ultimately to keep her at arms length lest he find himself dead. Tivadol the Destroyer desires her greatly, but of course out of spite, she pays him no attention other than scorn and disinterest. Sesisek and her have had some “encounters”, but such encounters are in the past as it seems due to her actions, Sesisek’s position was demoted and she took his place. He dislikes her intensely and hopes to get revenge on her one day. She finds this to be incredibly hilarious.  As with most of her kind she’s a wily one and uses her sex appeal as weapon whenever possible. This sometimes leads her to be playful, especially with mortals who often know no better until the last fatal moment. Though she’s quite capable of being brutally sadistic when she desires (Often at that last fatal moment). This playfulness has extended towards you sometimes, though her feelings towards you are a bit more of fascination rather than seduction. She has often said that for a moral you’re one of the more “interesting” ones, but due to your dedication to necromancy she finds your line of work to be “unfun”. This is likely due to the fact that she is a creature that exploits and thrives off of emotions and feelings. The dead don’t have such weaknesses; therefore the dead are no fun.  However as you are still alive, she perhaps thinks that you may be a little fun…"
7397,87,"Tivadol is a typical “rank and file” demon. Brutal, violent, sadistic, full of hate, and wants everything his way and decides the best way of getting it is to smash somebody over the head and take it. The only thing that makes him slightly different is he’s a bit more intelligent and has a burning desire to be in charge of everything. This is what makes him a good general.  It’s also what makes him a threat to Velzix. Tivadol barely contains the fact that he wants to take over Velzix’s position one day. This attitude is probably why he’s put on the frontlines and leading the most dangerous attacks. If he wins Velzix gains more territory, if he dies, then that’s good too!  Tivadol knows this of course and decided that he shall gain more respect in displaying that he’s a battlefield general rather than an armchair one. Then when the time is right, he’ll take Velzix’s throne by storm. A simple and short sighted plan. One that will probably not come to pass as Velzix is too intelligent to be overthrown by a straightforward coup. Tivadol might be successful if he employed a little subterfuge, but he doesn’t have the patience for it. This is another reason why Tivadol wants Sinthinia on his side (Besides her obvious physical qualities of course) since she could take care of such things. So far he’s been unsuccessful in convincing her.  He doesn’t respect Sesisek (Considers him to be a fool who allowed himself to lose his status and never liked him to begin with) and respects you even less. As you are a mortal, he doesn’t even know why Velzix deals with you and sees this as a weakness in him. The fact that you have great power of the dead doesn’t impress him. He just sees you as another weak mortal that will have to be crushed when he takes power sooner or later.  And if he gets his way, sooner.   Sesisek is a very very bitter demon. He’s been assigned a position that he doesn’t want, he’s not liked and barely respected. And worse he can’t do too much about it right now.  At one time he was Velzix’s left hand demon. (Right hand would be inappropriate here) He had spies everywhere and dealt in secrets, blackmail and assassination. He made sure he didn’t have to answer to anyone except Velzix, and if things had gone as planned he wouldn’t have had to answer to him for too much longer either.  However a succubus called Sinthinia came along and fucked up everything for him. All his plotting, planning, and doubling dealings all came to be meaningless thanks to her actions. He had no more clout after what happened, and to add further insult Velzix allowed him to live and do menial humiliating jobs. However, Sesisek’s time in the infernal plane most likely still would’ve been a short one as other demons would’ve taken revenge for his past dealings; the only thing that saved him was the Dark Order summoning to your world. As a result he was given a slight reprieve and he’s even gained some of his status back since Velzix does know him to be competent and the fact that Velzix needs all the help he can get right now to get a strong foothold on your world.  He’s been given a military position to keep him out of the way and preoccupied (Much like Tivadol) but due to his brethren’s intense lack of respect of him, he’s only leading mortal troops. He can’t stand mortals and could care less if they die by the thousands, he dislikes being a military leader, (He preferred the subtle approach to power) and on top of all this his mind is constantly plagued by thoughts of revenge. All of this means his success on the battlefield is mediocre at best. He does a good enough job to make it appear like he’s still useful.  He hates Sinthinia for betraying him, but even more for the fact that she was so successful at it. He hates Velzix for continuing to humiliate him. He finds Tivadol to be an idiotic brute who doesn’t know shit about real power. As for you, he doesn’t particularly care about you at all, except he doesn’t find you to be a threat since you’re a mortal. He recognizes you do have some power about you and along with being on direct speaking terms with Velzix, you speak to Sinthinia on occasion as well. He probably figures that maybe he can use you in some sort of mad plan for revenge.  It’s all that drives him at point."
7397,88,"The self-professed “good guys” are made up of several civilized governments. The Zalan Empire (Your former home and where your family lives) is one of the main members of the Grand Alliance. Several races belong, each one bringing their unique skills to the mix. It’s quite possible to see the clockwork automatons of the Dwarven Union fighting side by side with the silent monks of Elin.  This arrangement only arises during times of great crisis such as the one you caused. Given that most living creatures have basic need to not want to die or become a walking rotting corpse (Or a slave to demons) the chances of you convincing them to leave you alone is extremely unlikely especially since Velzix has no intention on doing it anyway.   Most of your knowledge of them comes from the Ex-Dark Order demonologists who knew of Mr. Demar’s dealings with them. Apparently their relationship wasn’t a good one though when talks of a possible alliance failed and one of their delegates was killed by Trelik.  The Vampire Clans from what you know live in a fortress run by Lord Rostov. This fortress’ location is unknown and hidden by powerful magic. It is there where those few remaining vampires that have kept their faculties stay. (As opposed to the near mindless ones that lurk in holes in the wilderness)  While groups of vampires may have been involved in their own political intrigues and agendas in the past, the term Vampire Clans now is somewhat of a misnomer since Lord Rostov has a firm command over the remaining vampires. It’s basically a dictatorship more than a “council” where they all sit around discussing things. The term Clans is probably kept to just hold on to the illusion of former glory of freedom rather than the reality that they’re all hiding in a secret fortress ruled by a tyrant.  Despite their reduced power, they still can affect mortal affairs. Currently they are no doubt affecting these affairs to hinder you and Velzix. The death of their delegate pissed them off pretty severely, not to mention they don’t agree with “high profile” necromancy. And they really don’t want demons running around all over the place. All of these things disrupt the status quo and their way of life. This is unacceptable to them.  Velzix received a letter by bat from them recently saying that his actions will not go unopposed by the Clans and that his days on this world are numbered. He of course laughed at this threat and ate the bat."
7397,89,"Never. You’ll never submit to anyone else’s rule. You’d rather die first. But if you can help it, maybe you can eliminate one rival right now.  You don’t answer Velzix’s offer, you immediately attack! You blast Velzix, with a beam of negative energy. Your nearby undead soldiers rush at Velzix, and your necromancers provide some back up.  Velzix somewhat expected your attack though, and he blocks your beam with a magic shield and then flies through the wall of your fortress burning your corpse soldiers in the way.  “Short-sighted little dead wizard! You’ve sealed your own doom!” you hear him shout as he flies away back to his own realm.  You aren’t impressed by his threats however, you order your wall to be fixed, while you plan your next move…  A year passes… The Kingdom of Tulan has finally put the sword to every last demon infesting the area. You laugh when you hear how easily Velzix was defeated, however this celebration is soon short lived.  The Grand Alliance attempts another siege of the city and this time they succeed. You barely manage to escape. You try to establish some sort of rule elsewhere, but the Grand Alliance isn’t letting you get dug in again.  You begin your long road of hardship and keep to rural areas; many times you barely survive attacks from barbaric orc tribes. Fortunately your skills in necromancy protect you (as well as scare the hell out of the orcs)      Two years pass... You hear them coming for you, there is no more running. This is your fate. To die in this cave. You think bitterly about Velzix’s all too correct prediction about your fate. You wonder if you’d been less prideful and accepted his offer, you wouldn’t be in this state you are right now.  You shake your head to this however. No point in regrets. You’ve made your choices and now you make one last one.  You leave the cave to face your enemies and prepare to die for your heinous crimes…  Such is often the fate of a necromancer."
7397,90,"You weren’t impressed with these losers before and you’re still not impressed with them now.  “Yeah, well I got my own plans. Thanks for the heads up on the city though, guess I’ll leave this shithole.” You say. “Hey! Come on! Where do you think you’re going to go? Staying here is your best shot at survival, we just gotta…” “Let him go Sebastian, we don’t need the likes of him helping us!”  With those last words ringing in your ears, you march out of the city with your undead horde ready to take on the world.  Your first stop is some little town on the outskirts of the Brot Kingdom. You’re merciless. You slaughter all those that oppose you, leaving none alive. Your army grows and you march on to other endeavors, but not really having any kind of plan other than mindless slaughter…  One month passes The Incident at Nuro has become well known knowledge and while the take over was a failure, much damage was done. A temporal disturbance in the heart of the city has made the entire area unstable as buildings phase in and out of existence. Mr. Demar and most of his Dark Order were killed though a few managed to escape and go into hiding. Demons have been running rampant through the countryside and seem to have taken an interest in the Kingdom of Tulan.  You’re a well known threat due to your actions in Brot Kingdom. Already mercenaries are on your trail. You have to keep to the rural parts of the countryside where you come in conflict with several barbaric Orc tribes. You of course add these to your army when you’re done massacring them.  One year passes The Kingdom of Tulan has finally put the sword to every last demon infesting the area. Most of the demonologist have been caught and hung for their crimes as well.  You now have the Grand Alliance’s attention and they hound you at every turn. You refuse to give up. They will know your full power, just like your Dad did when you utterly destroyed his mercenary company that attempted to stop you.  How you laughed when he attempted to still grab his sword to strike you even though he had been separated from his lower half at the time. You put the old bastard out of his delusions when he gurgled to you that no good would come of your path. Hah! Like he knew what it’s like to be a “good man.”  Still you always wondered what Mom thinks…but then you don’t want to know what she thinks of you. A twinge of sadness strikes you, before you erase it entirely from your thoughts.  You press on further north.    Two more years pass Nuro has completely collapsed in on itself due to the temporal disturbance leaving nothing but a gaping hole there; a war breaks out in the nearby area.  You suffer four attacks from the Grand Alliance and several attacks from various other forces. Your sister was leading the last Grand Alliance attack, and you barely escaped. You’re the last “problem” from the Nuro Incident that needs to be eliminated.  You’re growing weaker from the lack of rest, and you turn to eating dead flesh to survive.  Survival, that’s all you care about now.  Two more years pass You can hear them coming, you curse the fact that you left yourself no retreat. You’re magically spent and exhausted. Fuck it.  You walk towards your pursuers and prepare to die for your heinous crimes…  Such is often the fate of a necromancer."
7397,91,"Once again you have second thoughts. You can’t do this. You can’t become a necromancer; it’s not going to make your life any easier and is only going to make it vastly more difficult. You figure with your mediocre grades and magic skills, you can probably get a job working at children’s parties or something after you graduate. That least if you make a mistake it’ll be “funny” and just be part of the act. Your Mom probably won’t be too disappointed since she also works with children and you give a shit what your Dad thinks.  Yep, that’ll probably be your “life”.  You don’t go meet Big Red and instead take the next carriage home to visit your family for vacation. Your Mom is happy to see you and makes the appropriate fuss. Your sister is okay when she stops by between her duties. In fact for awhile you don’t feel so bad about your life. Sure it’ll be dull and not very glamorous, but you can deal with it…  After a month of your visit, your Dad finally comes back from one of his mercenary jobs. He’s in a typical asshole mood and gives you a bunch of shit as soon as he walks in the door. He belittles what few accomplishments you have, compares you to your sister and is a general dick to you as usual.  While your Mom attempts to rein him in, you leave the house and curse your Dad. He always spoils everything for you. You can’t wait for classes to start again just to get away from the old bastard.  You almost wished you’d taken that risk and attempted to kill Big Red and get that necromantic book. The powers it must’ve contained…you know you would’ve been able to master them. The more you think about this, the more you think that might be what you’ll do when classes start again.  After two more months of putting up with your family, you’re heading back to school. Once again your “feelings” have died down again. You’re not going to kill Big Red or any of that, you’re going to go to class and struggle as usual.  You’re going to be less than an average nobody. You’re going to live the rest of your life like a halfling.  But not for long…  About a week after classes start, something terrible happens in the city of Nuro. Portals suddenly open up all over the city and demons come pouring out of them. Loud explosions take place and there’s a strange feeling of “slowness” occurring to you and most others.  You’re in class at the time when this chaos begins. It’s obviously an attack of some sort, but nobody knows from where or who, right now everyone is just trying to escape.  Demons run amok through the streets and campus gleefully killing people. Running while suffering the effects of this aura of slowness is proving very difficult so you try to stay hidden most of the time.  Demonologists direct this attack, you even recognize a couple as students you went to class with. Apparently you weren’t the only one with the dark arts on your mind.  Eventually you get closer to the city gates and that’s when you see a horde of recently raised corpses lingering around it. You think maybe you can make it. The dead aren’t known to be fast after all.   You make your run and the group of corpses and skeletons notice you and shamble in your direction. Normally if you weren’t slowed, you probably might make it, but instead they manage to surround you and cut off escape in any direction. In desperation you cry out for this to stop and wishing that somehow they would stop attacking you.  And for a moment, they do. They just stand there obediently. You can’t believe it; you just stand there in shock, not taking advantage of the situation.  Did you really have a natural gift for necromancy after all?  Unfortunately, you’ll never know because they quickly resume attacking and strike you down before moving on.  As you lie in the street dying from your wounds, you laugh at the absurdity of it all.  “Ha ha…I coulda…(cough) been…the next Great Lich Lord…”"
7397,92,"History is it? Well you were never really good at that either, however you did manage to maintain some knowledge of the subject, which is probably more than what can be said for your magic abilities!"
7397,93,"Your world is a strange mixture of magic and technology. While magic exists, it isn’t used by everyone as naturally most people don’t have the aptitude for it. (You being on the borderline!) and of course there are laws concerning the use of it under most governments. Technology such as gunpowder weapons and other things like steam engines exists to a limited degree. Only the rich nations such as the Zalan Empire can afford to place money in such experimental things.  Most of the world is “civilized” in that parts of it have governing bodies to rule it. Though large stretches of untamed land do exist and “civilization” can be relative in the case of some nations. Many different races exist, though how they get along is another matter.  The landscape on your world is quite varied ranging from deserts, to grasslands, to snowy mountains. But as far as anyone knows, only one large mass exists on your world. Many sailors have attempted to find other possible land masses, but all attempts have yielded nothing. The oceans do not contain any known sentient creatures, though large sea serpents have been sighted in the deep ocean by a few sailors that have barely come back alive from their circumnavigation around the world.  The underground is home to some races, though not as many dwell down there as one might assume. Nor is it a place where evil lurks, (though it can be) the underground is merely another place where some choose to live. Nobody ever chooses to live too deep underground however as the deeper one goes the more unlivable and inhospitable it is to make into a home.  The skies are clear. At one time there were a few large floating fortresses in the clouds, but during the Dead War, powerful magic cast by the Great Lich Lord caused these to crash to the ground and kill millions. After such an occurrence, it was decided that the risk was too great to have that happen again. The last of the dragons also died during the Dead War.  As for where you’re located in the world, you’re enrolled at Nuro Magic College.  The Nuro Magic College is located in the City State of Nuro imaginatively enough. In fact the college basically IS the city given how large a part it plays in it.  Nuro maintains its independence due to its neutrality and large magic surplus that would make even the largest of empires feel the pain if it was ever attempted to be invaded.  However, invasion is unlikely by any current nation as its Magic College is the best and is open to ALL citizens of other nations, provided they can pay the tuition costs. This also makes Nuro fairly prosperous.  Practically anything you could want is in Nuro, and if it isn’t it can easily be acquired due to magic."
7397,94,"Chapter 1: Dark Beginnings   Well, you did it again. You slacked off all semester and didn’t study for your finals. There’s no way you’re going to pass your nature magic test tomorrow. Those things are always killers. You don’t even know why you enrolled in that class; you aren’t even interested in being a nature mage. You don’t even like the damn outdoors!  Oh wait, you know why, it’s because you saw a cute witch taking the class, so like a dumb ass, you signed up for it. Naturally the moment you tried to impress her with some sort of cantrip, she laughed at you and said even if she was straight, she wouldn’t go for a half assed hedge wizard like you! You really should’ve known better, half of those witches are lesbians anyway. That whole Mother Earth Goddess worship caters to the rug munching. (And no, there aren’t any MALE witches, any self respecting man would call himself a WARLOCK, not a damn witch!)  (Sigh) Like your little sister’s B’ar’b Dolly once said “Magic is hard!” Indeed. Sometimes you curse the day your mother passed her magical elven blood on to you.  Still, you’re here now, so you need to make the best out of your life. You’re already going to hear it from both of your parents of how you’ve been nothing but a disappointment to the both of them. Your Dad will probably do a little more than say that, he’ll probably personally ride up to the University and beat the hell out of you for wasting his hard earned pillaging money to send you there in the first place.  Arrgh! You just wish you were good at SOME kind of magic! You have the ability; you just don’t have the focus! That’s always been the problem with you. Your sister has it easy, she took after Dad. Narrow minded focus on killing someone with a blunt instrument doesn’t take too much effort. Of course you had to be the one that greater things were expected of.  You’ve tried all the schools, evocation, conjuration, illusion, divination; all of them. You can’t excel in any of it. You can only get so far and then the words and gestures and well all of it just becomes too fucking confusing for you.  However, you haven’t tried the “darker arts”, but your Mom would definitely never approve. (Your Dad probably wouldn’t care, but if you upset your Mom, it’s a warhammer upside the head) In fact it’s illegal to study any of them. They caused too much trouble in the past and nearly destroyed the world at one time. All who are known to even dabble in such arts are immediately taken into custody and executed.  You don’t think you’d want to be summoning demons anyway; even the few “friendly ones” that work on campus are fucking assholes to the Nth degree. You can only imagine how bad the ones who haven’t been living among mortals are.  However there is another dark art which you have to admit you’ve always had a bit of curiosity about.  The art in question is necromancy.  At this point you’re willing to at least see if you’re good at ANYTHING, so for shits and giggles you decide to blow off your test which you’re going to fail anyway and go see if you can find out more about this outlawed dark art.  Though being a lazy sort you decide to try the library first."
7397,95,"Many kingdoms, empires, city states, oligarchies, and the like exist on the continent, but even though they all compete with each other there is one pact that none of them break.  No dabbling in the dark arts ever. This means no summoning creatures unnatural to the world, but more importantly no Necromancy. Typically such a wide spread pact would normally be dismissed and broken by one government at some point in time, but so great was the threat long ago that for the good of all living creatures this one treaty has ALWAYS been upheld.  Long ago, there was a war called the Dead War. How it began exactly is unclear, but it was a time of great violence, chaos and horror. The very existence of life was nearly extinguished and it was only due to several heroes that the Great Lich Lord (His real name is lost to history) was finally defeated, putting an end to this threat.  Ever since those dark years, the art of Necromancy has been outlawed and any tome containing the teachings of it, destroyed. In the events of the undead being spotted, nearly no effort is spared to destroy such creatures. Most of the time such events are caused by simple magic leaks, or magical experiments that accidentally raise such undead creatures, but investigations are typically done, just to make sure there isn’t a budding Necromancer at work.  “Higher” forms of undead such as Vampires still exist, but as can be expected they have been forced to hide, most have been reduced to being little better than ghouls that live in a dark hole in the wilderness and constantly having to stay one step ahead of nosey adventurers. Liches supposedly no longer exist, as any discovered Necromancers are killed long before they can reach such power.  Still rumors always abound about some Lich in some obscure part of the world that is slowly building up another undead force in yet another attempt to destroy all life.  The Dead War may long be over, but the fear of a second one will forever loom over the world."
7397,96,"The other off limits dark arts would be summoning demons. During the middle of the Dead War, one cabal of wizards decided to risk all by making a pact with the infernal forces in exchange for their help to fight the undead. This plan was doomed from the beginning as demons have loyalty to no one save themselves. Eventually the demons managed to break their contract and most began to run amok killing everything. Oddly it was the Great Lich Lord himself that finally closed the demon portals as they interfered with his own plans of dominating the world.  There are few demons left in the world, most of them having been killed by both sides, but the ones that do exist only do so because of their own trickery and guile. Indeed, many have managed to worm their way into civilization and making themselves “useful” and pointing out that “they” were not the demons that betrayed the pact (For some reason every demon that still roams the world NEVER seems to be the one that betrayed anyone) While some may have integrated into society, nearly all still maintain their asshole disposition. Demons are still not welcomed in all parts of the world and most of the time still killed on sight, though naturally the more morally “relaxed” governments accept them and the powers they can provide.  It should be noted that Demons don’t particularly like one another either, so the idea that they would attempt to open a portal to their own infernal realm is slim. The last thing they want to do is give more competition for themselves…or so they say.  They are demons after all."
7397,97,"Your birth was an unusual one, which is a kind way of saying “accidental”. You were born of a union of an elven mother and a ruthless human marauder whose own ancestry probably has ogrish blood. How they met was quite beautiful though. Your Dad was storming an elven castle and after putting several pointy ears to their deaths he came across your Mom who was being held in a special tower to ensure her purity for her eventual marriage to a High Elven Prince. She was raised and conditioned to be a perfect wife and even had spells infused into her being to forge a bond with her potential mate. Of course your Dad didn’t know all that, he just saw a fine piece of elven ass and naturally after all that killing, your Dad was in the mood for some lovin…  Normally after such actions he most likely would’ve killed her or passed her over to the rest of his men where upon one of them would’ve killed her after they had their fun, but something unexpected occurred. Rotten ol’ Dad fell in love, possibly for the first time in his life. The reasons are somewhat unclear, though you believe that it strongly has something to do with the magical aura of your mother’s conditioning. (Which also explains why she stayed a bastard who had basically raped her and killed her family) Instead of killing her he felt like doing stupid stuff like being nice to her and giving her sparkly things of great monetary value. He even carried her carefully out of the burning castle.  Of course this didn’t go over too well with the usual bunch of cutthroats he hung around with at the time, and he was severely taunted, mocked and even challenged. All of that soon stopped though after he killed everyone and married your Mom. The Elven Prince she was originally supposed to marry actually breathed a sigh of relief when it was discovered, since as it turned out he thought girls were “icky” and it was only to be a political marriage in the first place.  Soon your father found that he now had actual responsibilities beyond his own selfish pleasures. Not only did he now have a wife, he had a baby on the way. Your mother’s influence was taking more of a hold on him as well. He agreed to give up his banditry and marauder ways, and instead became a mercenary in which he could at least somewhat legally justify any misdeeds he might be involved in. Your mother who had been sheltered for so long became enamored with city life, so they both moved into a nice house in the Zalan Empire where she became a school teacher for young children.  Soon you were born and your father hoped that you might follow in his footsteps (At this point he was eager to show his “offspring” all the cool ways to kill people) but it was obvious that you took more after your mother even if not the talent.  While your Dad might’ve become a “changed man” due to your Mom, he didn’t change that much. You had to hear the verbal abuse and endure a lot of physical hardship (Such as him taking you out to the wilderness where he wanted you to learn how to survive for three day just wearing a loincloth!), before he finally “gave up” on making you into a warrior. Still, you probably did learn how to fight better than most wizards, but of course you’re FAR from being a “real” wizard! Fortunately Dad wasn’t at home for long stretches at a time since his mercenary work often kept him busy. You don’t mind saying about how sometimes you wished he never came back at all! But the old bastard was just too damn tough to die. Even in that rarity when his entire companies have been killed, he’d always somehow manage to come back more or less in one piece.  The man still can inspire fear in you, even though you’ve moved away and are an adult now. He’s the one mainly paying for your education, so it’s probably good that’s he’s still alive despite his threats and past abuse.  Your Mom of course is nicer, and fortunately did try to shelter you from some of your Dad’s wrath. However she’s been pushy in her own way. The moment your Dad gave up on you, she immediately stepped in and took over. From that point she was bound and determined to groom you to be that great wizard that she KNOWS you’re going to be. Sometimes you wish she wouldn’t place so much faith in you, because quite frankly you don’t have that much aptitude and you don’t understand how she can’t see that, though you’re guessing that she purposely ignores that little fact. In her mind, you’re going to be a great wizard no matter what, so after high school you were to be sent to the Magic College in Nuro.  Besides Mom and Dad, there’s Sis who was born shortly after you were. Sis is your Dad’s favorite. When it was apparent you weren’t warrior material, he noticed how your younger sister would always watch you and he spar. So he threw a sword to her and told her to show him what she had. Of course being very young at the time, she could barely hold the weapon, but it was obvious genetics favored her as a warrior and had natural ability. He might’ve even taken her on mission with him, but your Mom wasn’t having that. She did of course in time hone her skills to a great degree. So much so that she would become the youngest candidate to ever join the Zalan Empire’s Elite Guard. Though your Dad wasn’t exactly ecstatic with that decision as he’d much preferred her to be a mercenary like him, rather than a governmental “pawn” (as he believes) but he can respect the battle skill.  As for your relationship with her, she sometimes bullied you when she got a little more skilled with fighting techniques, though sometimes it really helped to have a warrior sister to have your back at times, like when you got jumped by some Orc youths who were attempting to rob you. She single handedly defeated them all using only her fists. Of course when you both got home SHE took your money anyway! However, she eventually was nicer to you after she developed her sense of justice.  As far as families go, you probably could’ve done worse."
7397,98,"You live in a small apartment alone which is much more expensive and pisses off your Dad for having to spend the money, but your Mom managed to convince him that you need your privacy to study (She also managed to convince him that you shouldn’t get a job as it would take away from your studies) However, you probably do more slacking than studying and lately you’ve been doing a lot more of it.  Normally you spend a lot of time in your apartment not doing too much of anything except writing about your thoughts in your journal. Sometimes you go out and try to socialize, but you find you don’t have too much in common with anyone. Even in this giant melting pot of races, and cultures, you find most of them to all just be the same. Occasionally hormones kick in and you attempt to get laid, with varying success, but ever since your high school sweetheart died, you don’t even feel like doing that too much anymore. She was supposed to come with you to Nuro Magic College. You and she had such plans, but of course those died with her. You often think that if she’d lived you’d be more motivated to try harder.  Life in general is beginning to feel like you’re just going through the motions and “faking it”. You feel like you’re becoming more detached from the world, which probably explains why you’ve been dwelling on death a lot. Not really your own, but just in general. All this kind of thinking has got you wondering about Necromancy a lot lately.  It’s getting down to crunch time and you don’t know how you’re going to face your parents about this semester. College hasn’t been working out too well for you and given your recent unhealthy interest in Necromancy, chances are the rest of your life might not either.  Then again maybe it just might…"
