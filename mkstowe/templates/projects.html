    <h2>Mission O-Possumble</h2>
    <h3>C#, Unity</h3>
    <p>An original game made from scratch in Unity with a team of three other students. Using an Agile workflow over the
        course of about seven weeks, we made all original assets and art to make a unique and challenging game that
        ended up winning second place in the Umich and EMU showcase at the end of the semester.

    <h2>theCurlyBot</h2>
    <h3>Python</h3>
    <p>A reddit bot - called theCurlyBot - that I created with a small team using Python. Our bot pulls fake news
        headlines from the subreddit /r/TheOnion, and real (but fake-sounding) headlines from /r/NotTheOnion. It then
        runs a natural language processing algorithm on the pool of headlines that it continually collects, and makes
        its own fake news headlines that it then posts to its own subreddit.

    <h2>Image Resizing</h2>
    <h3>C++</h3>
    <p>A program written in C++ that resizes images without cropping them. It inputs the original image, and removes
        rows and columns of unneeded pixels based on the pixels that surround it until reaching the desired size. This
        allows the image to be resized without much noticeable change in terms of content.
