        <h3>Python, Flask, (more technologies to be determined)</h3>
        <h4>In Progress</h4>

        <p>Independent research project conducted under Austin Yarger. The goal is to explore how machine learning can
            be used to create unique stories and narratives in a video game by automatically structuring a tree of
            relevant events based on what is currently happening to the player.</p>

        <p>An original game made from scratch in Unity with a team of three other students. Using an Agile workflow over the
            course of about seven weeks, we made all original assets and art to make a unique and challenging game that
            ended up winning second place in the Umich and EMU showcase at the end of the semester.</p>

        <h2>theCurlyBot</h2>
        <h3>Python</h3>
        <p>A reddit bot - called theCurlyBot - that I created with a small team using Python. Our bot pulls fake news
            headlines from the subreddit /r/TheOnion, and real (but fake-sounding) headlines from /r/NotTheOnion. It then
            runs a natural language processing algorithm on the pool of headlines that it continually collects, and makes
            its own fake news headlines that it then posts to its own subreddit.
