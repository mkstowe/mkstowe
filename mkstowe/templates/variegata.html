    <h2>Project Variegata</h2>
    <div class="seg">
        <p>The goal of Project Variegata is to explore ways that machine learning and other programming techniques can
        be used to create comprehensive and engaging stories to be applied to various types of media (notably video
        games).</p>

    <p>By automating the process of connecting plot points in different ways on the fly, the consumer can
        have a compelling story presented to them that continually changes based on their choices. No two paths are
        necessarily the same.</p>

        <h4 class="blog_topic"><strong>Stakeholder Information</strong></h4>
        <p>While any stakeholders in the entertainment industry could benefit from research such as this, I am
            gearing it more toward video game designers. Video games, often more so than other story-based media,
            requires a less-than-linear story to be available to the consumer. As a result, designers of these video
            games would have a greater need for a tool to help keep those stories interesting and engaging for the
            player.</p>
        <p>People who love video games, myself included, value an intricate plot that can change depending on the
            player's choices. This interactivity leads to re-playability, making the game more valuable in the eyes
            of the customer. Putting funds, designers' knowledge, and ample technology into research to create
            increasingly intriguing stories benefits all parties involved.</p>

        <h4 class="blog_topic"><strong>Market Information</strong></h4>
        <p>The market sector most closely related to this project would be the Communication Services sector -
            specifically the Media and Entertainment branch.</p>
        <p>As of 2018, the Media and Entertainment industry is worth about $703 billion. [<a
                href="https://investmentbank.com/media-and-entertainment-industry-overview/" target="_blank">source</a>]
        </p>
        <p>In October of 2020, this industry had approximately 1.74 million employees. [<a
                href="https://www.bls.gov/data/" target="_blank">source</a>]</p>
        <p>The five largest companies in this industry are Comcast, The Walt Disney Co., Charter Communications,
            ViacomCBS, and Bollor√© SA. [<a

        </p>
        <p>Some existing products in this industry that could benefit most include video games, movies, TV shows,
            books, and advertisements.</p>
