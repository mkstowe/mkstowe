        <p>Before I could get working on my assigned tasks for the pre-alpha sprint, I had to get familiar with the
            existing code base. A working prototype of the project had already been created prior to my involvement,
            so I spent some time reading through what my teammates had already written to ensure I had a good idea of
            what was going on. Getting used to the code base and becoming acquainted with the preferred style and
            coding paradigms is essential when joining any project and making sure things go smoothly.</p>
        <p>In addition to reading the code, I also spent time looking through Confluence and Jira to read in more
            detail the things that were discussed during the weekly meetings. I read through the design documents,
            taking note of how I figured would be the best way to approach the programming aspect of the different
            features to be implemented.</p>

        <h3 class="blog_topic"><strong>Operating System Woes</strong></h3>
        <p>When it comes to programming, I am very much a fan of Linux over Windows. With that, however, comes some
            compatibility issues. I unfortunately had to spend a lot of time figuring out how to get Unity to work
            with my system. Once I finally got it Unity installed everything seemed a-okay! But as soon as I
            launched the game for the first time, everything broke and I had no choice but to wallow in self pity. I
            ended up just reinstalling Windows and dealing with it.</p>

        <h3 class="blog_topic"><strong>Quick Melee</strong></h3>
        <p>The first task I worked on was the quick melee mechanic. This task took a bit longer than anticipated,
            largely due to the fact that I wanted to pay extra close attention to making sure my code adhered to the
            style guides of the studio.</p>
        <p>This task consisted of implementing a quick melee attack for the player character. The main inspiration
            for this mechanic is Lucio's "boop" attack from Overwatch. Essentially when activating the quick melee,
            the character emits a short-ranged burst of force in front of them. Any enemies within its range will
            take damage and be knocked back. The mechanic has an adjustable damage, range, knockback strength, and
            cooldown period that will later be adjusted to be balanced once we being doing more playtests.</p>
        <p>Time: 4.5 hours</p>

        <h3 class="blog_topic"><strong>Melee to Air</strong></h3>
        <p>Next up was to add the "melee to air" mechanic to the quick melee. This is basically where, if the player
            successfully melees an enemy while the player is in the air, they are launched vertically upward around
            3-4x their normal jump height. This can be used as a platforming mechanic to get to some hard-to-reach
            areas that normal jumping would not be good enough for.</p>
        <p>The main issue I ran in to during this implementation was being able to accurately determine if the
            player is grounded. When diving into the code and using lots of logging and temporary variables for
            debugging, I determined that there was some odd behavior going on in the existing movement system. This
            bugginess prevents normal grounded checking to sometimes fail, meaning that it is very difficult to tell
            whether or not the player is in the air at any given time. This problem will likely be fixed for next
            sprint once we revamp some aspects of the movement system.</p>
        <p>Time: 3 hours</p>

        <h3 class="blog_topic"><strong>Melee VFX</strong></h3>
        <p>The next step was to incorporate the visual effects that one of the talented individuals on the VFX team
            implemented. Overall, this was a pretty simple process. There was one issue where the camera didn't
            properly render the particle effects used for the effect when in some orientations, but the VFX artist
            was able to fix it pretty easily.</p>

        <h3 class="blog_topic"><strong>Glide</strong></h3>
        <p>The final task I worked on this sprint was the glide. This is where when the player is falling, they can
            hold the jump key to glide through the air, falling to the ground at a slower rate. Like melee to air,
            this mechanic will probably need to be updated once the movement system is updated, but for now it is
            working as intended with an adjustable glide duration and fall rate.</p>
        <p>Time: 2 hours</p>
