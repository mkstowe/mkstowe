    <h2>What is Living Arts?</h2>
    <p>"The goal of Living Arts is to spur and support collaborative, creative work
        across disciplinary boundaries and to provide an open, playful environment
        that encourages students to generate and pursue new ideas."</p>

    <h2>Mentoring</h2>
    <p>During my second year of college, I was a peer-mentor to a group of three
        first-year students. As a mentor, I led my group - as well as other new
        students in the community - through various projects and events. The goal
        was to help transition into college, help these students learn more about
        their creative processes, and be a source of information and advice. Two
        of the students in my group even went on to become mentors to their own
        groups for the next wave of students!</p>

    <h2>Workshops</h2>
    <p>To encourage creativity in different disciplines, the community
        participated in various workshops which were often led by professionals in
        the respective fields. </p>

    <h3>Movie</h3>
    <p>For the first workshop of the year, we got into groups to tell a story
        through a five minute movie. We learned about the process of creating
        a story, filming, and editing the video. We were able to witness
        first-hand the creative process involved in both the technical and the
        imaginative parts of film making.</p>

    <h3>Dance</h3>
    <p>The goal of this workshop was for the community to get to know
        each other and to express our creativity through movement. Led by
        Professor of Dance Amy Chavasse, we went undertook different
        activities that utilized the body's senses to embrace an unorthodox
        method of creative outlet.</p>

    <h3>Video Game</h3>
    <p>Lecturer Austin Yarger guided the community through a workshop that
        explored the creativity involved with video games. We learned about
        parts of the process of making video games, and we even came up with
        ideas for our own games. Finally, we learned about how coding, art,
        music, and other disciplines are all involved in making a video game -
        using Toby Fox's Undertale as an example.</p>

    <h3>Culture</h3>
    <p>For the last of the workshops, the Living Arts Residential Advisers led
        a workshop that involved the groups creating their own society and
        culture based on different snacks. We got to have fun by going back to
        elementary school days and using tri-boards to make presentations
        about the creative societies that we came up with.</p>

    <h2>Creative Collaborative Project (CCP)</h2>
    <p>The grand finale of each year in Living Arts is the Creative Collaborate
        Project. This is where each mentor/mentee group works together to create a
        project that encapsulates some topic. The groups can be as concise or as broad
        as they like. Once all of the projects were complete. the entire community
        joins to share our projects and to experience what all of our peers came
        up with.</p>

    <h3>Typewriter</h3>
    <p>My group was assigned the word "Evolve" as our topic for the CCP. We
        decided that rather than make a project that explains what it means to
        evolve, we would make a project that was a form of evolution itself. To do
        this, we bought an antique typewriter and placed it in various locations
        around campus. Each location was a new "chapter" and started with a
        quote from a literary work. With the typewriter set up with the
        prompt, we just left it for passersby to interact with it however they
        saw fit. This resulted in a continually evolving story full of emotion,
        hilarity, and nonsense.</p>
